# Filecoin Grants


Welcome to the Filecoin Grant Platform! The Filecoin Grant Platform connects grant makers with builders and researchers in the Filecoin community. Whether you represent a foundation that wants to move the space forward, a company looking to accelerate development on the features your application needs, or a dev team itching to hack on Filecoin tools, you've come to the right place. Take a look at the supported grant types and available opportunities below.

## Grant Types

---

### Next Step Microgrants
Grants of $5,000 in FIL are available to support taking the _next step_ after you have created an initial prototype with Filecoin. These grants are intended for independent developers, small studios, non-profits, activists, and researchers. Applicants may be working independently, or as part of a course or hackathon. The microgrants are intended for early stage projects.  If your project has already received more than $30,000 USD from any source, please apply for an open grant (details below) rather than a microgrant.

Acceptance criteria are very simple, and work is expected to be complete within 2 months. Adoption Microgrants are funded by Protocol Labs.

### Open Grant
Do you have an idea for pushing the Filecoin ecosystem forward? Grants of up to $30,000 are available to support novel ideas that advance the Filecoin ecosystem, bring significant new usage, or directly advance the Filecoin mission statement.

 Wave 11 proposal submissions are due **September 30, 2021 at 23:59 PDT** for priority consideration.

### Requests for Proposals (RFPs)
RFPs are grants for specific development work. As the name suggests, we are requesting proposals from teams that want to complete the work specified in each RFP. In these grants, we generally have clearly scoped deliverables, milestones, and funding limits. Some RFPs will ask you to propose your own milestones and funding needs. While there is some flexibility in RFP deliverables, we expect teams will deliver what is in scope in the RFP. Any deviations from the specified scope must be approved between your team and ours before we can approve funding. RFPs may be funded by Protocol Labs, other community members, or a consortium of interested parties.

OPEN RFPs:


[**Near Protocol x Filecoin**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/rfps/near-and-filecoin.md) -- Deadline October 30 

[**Chainlink x Filecoin**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/rfps/chainlink-and-filecoin.md) -- Open until December 2021
