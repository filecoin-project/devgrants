# Data Onboarding

## Overview
Protocol Labs and the Filecoin Foundation are working together to supercharge existing data onboarding efforts built on top of Filecoin through a pilot grant program that awards funding for these efforts.

This grants program aims to help support teams building paid products targeted at embedding Filecoin into the broader web3 community as a core infrastructure for critical use cases. This can range from making Filecoin the default storage layer for compute use cases, to helping scale the archiving requirements for DA layers and L1s, to enabling Filecoin to be the home for decentralized social networks. 


This grant program includes over 75,000 FIL, provided by PL and FF, and may include additional funds to be provided later on. Feedback from this initial set of funding awardees may guide future grants aimed at open source software to support and enable these specific project areas.

## Project Opportunities
Ultimately, this grant program aims to award teams who: 

1) increase **on-chain Filecoin deal and retrieval payments and settlements**, and
2) bring more **high-visibility, high-impact use-cases** to the Filecoin Network

## Applications, Deadlines and Deliverables 
**Teams should submit applications via [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeS089zv_4umhrNwZg3lrDUbSMhJW7ghwqHxSAvyZ42PPY5hQ/viewform) by July 5th, 2024**. Please note that while we have previously utilized GitHub submissions for grant programs, given the potentially sensitive nature of client agreements and engagements, we will be accepting direct applications via this form. While the final list of awardees will be public, we’ll respect commercial confidentiality.

In your application, you should provide a clear outline of the scope of work, milestones, timeframe, and funding requested. We’re looking for teams to convey how these funds will directly **accelerate technical roadmaps to close customers and enable paid data onboarding and retrievals** on the Filecoin network. 

## Eligibility and Criteria for Funding
- Eligible Grant Problem Statements: Grants will be available to teams that are onboarding high profile web3 clients including:
   - 1-5K FIL per blockchain or DA layer stored and available for retrievals (range depends on data size, market cap and activity of chain)
   - 1-5K FIL per DePIN, Compute or AI Network data stored and available for retrievals (range depends on data size, activity of network)Teams must specify target customers that, with additional engineering resources, **they have high confidence they could convert into paying customers for their services**. 
   - Custom grants for enabling egress from incumbent cloud platforms for paying customers
   - Teams must specify the work items they plan to complete (and rough engineering resources required to complete these items). 
   - Funding will be split across set milestones. 
- Prioritization for disbursement of funds will be determined based on:
   - **Speed of implementation** (i.e. items that will be delivered sooner are preferred)
   - **Speed at which deals will land on the network** (i.e. items that will be delivered sooner are preferred)
   - **Total aggregate data that will be brought on to the network** (larger data is better)
   - **Total dollars that will be sent to storage providers via onchain payments for storage deals and/or retrievals**
   - **Impact based on clients that are targeted**
   - **Robustness of client pipeline**
- Teams must share a public facing pricing strategy for storage clients. 
- Teams must support any ecosystem reporting / marketing case studies regarding the work done under this program.
- Teams that accept this funding must agree that for clients onboarded pursuant to this program, for at least 18 months: 
   - Data stored must include at least one copy providing with proofs on Filecoin.
   - Data must also be stored to be retrievable / usable by end users with a reasonable latency (e.g. < 5 seconds)
   - Payments to data onboarder and SPs must be settled (either directly or via a service provider) over the Filecoin network via FIL, stablecoins (wrapped or otherwise), or ERC20s on FVM. Applicants settling in FIL will be prioritized.
- Grant funds may only be used for product development, gas, or data migration costs for paying customers.
- Teams that are onboarding either Fil+ or non-Fil+ deals are eligible to receive funding
- Teams building open source reusable components for on chain payments will be prioritized.

## Review Timeline
The review period will take place during the first two weeks of July 2024 and the review committee will be comprised of the following community members: 

- Lauren Speigel (Filecoin Blue Fund)
- Porter Stowell (Filecoin Foundation)
- Stef Magdalinski (Filecoin Foundation)
- Jonathan Victor (Ansa Research)

During this time, the review committee can reach out to teams to clarify goals, ask additional questions, and pressure-test grant applications. 

All applicants made via the [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeS089zv_4umhrNwZg3lrDUbSMhJW7ghwqHxSAvyZ42PPY5hQ/viewform) by the deadline of **Ju1y 5th, 2024** should receive status updates before the end of July 2024.
