# RFP: `EpiK Protocol`

**Name of Project:** EpiK Protocol

**RFP Category:** `app-dev`

**Proposer:** `mia-yanhl`

## Project Description

EpiK Protocol proposed a solution of decentralized knowledge graph collaboration platform, where every user could contribute freely with efficiency and fairness. On EpiK network, we deployed IPFS technology to storage small KG bin-log files with the implementation of customized Filcoin Layer2 network; EPK token is given to contributors as incentive to encourage knowledge crowdsourcing; EVM is integrated to introduce more DeFi applications for better circulation of the token ecosystem. 

In such way, EpiK envisions to building a large-scale collaboration platform, where data flows freely, stimulating the growth of KG ecosystem, thus enables AI to evolve from perceptual intelligence to cognitive intelligence.

## Value

As EpiK partners with top academic institutions such as Big Data Lab of Tsinghua University and data enterprises such as ChinaSoft, EpiK has better access to Chinese industrial data than companies outside of China. EpiK could be complimentary to the Filecoin ecosystem, where EpiK provides diversified datasets. 

Moreover, with over 9,000 users in the Chinese community, EpiK could further increase the recognition of Filecoin, together they could build a better data economy.

Currently in series A funding, with a valuation of 50 million USD, EpiK has attracted noted VCs including two institutional investors and one US fund. It will bring synergy to the IPFS ecosystem.

## Deliverables

1. Trusted Storage - Integrated Filecoin Layer2 network

2. Trusted Incentive - Customized token economy model with 5 roles to maximize individual interests

3. Trusted Governance - Implemented DAO with deep binding of interests and voting power

4. Trusted Finance - Inegrated EVM, cross-chain gateways, oracles, and lending services

## Detailed Requirements & Constraints

1. 2021.Q1 release gamified knowledge crowdsourcing product v1.0 - *Knowledege Mainland*, which focus on vocie annotation tasks. The goal is to build the largest open Chinese voice library in 3 months. To date the largest open Chinese voice library, *Common Voice*, has a dataset with 120 hours voice file.
2. In April, finish the recruitement of the first batch of domain experts, to enrich the tasks in *Knowledge Mainland*. Domain experts will be announced when Mainnet launch. Currently we have confirmed domain experts: AI dataset *University AI*, Chinese and English text *Niucipol*, Voice data *d-ear*. NBA and gaming field expert recruitment in progress.
