# RFP: Hosting Community Meetups

**Name of Project:** Hosting Community Meetups

**RFP Category:** `community`

**Proposer:** [@pooja](https://github.com/pooja)

## Project Description

If you have an idea for a great Filecoin community event, or just want to get to know local members of the Filecoin community, this RFP is for you! We are looking for proposals for high-quality community meetups that foster connection and are focused on Filecoin. Your meetup could range from a few hours on a weekday evening to a multi-day hackathon! We expect your team to do all event organizing, marketing, fundraising/ticket sales, etc for the event. However, we can generally help by providing some swag or, depending on the event, a stipend.

Some ideas for community events that we would be happy to fund include:
- Meetups where the aim is to test Filecoin, file issues for any problems that arise, and fix some of them
- Bug bashes (fix some of the open Filecoin issues)
- Meetups focused on explaining key Filecoin concepts
- Decentralized storage meetups that host lightning talks from projects building on Filecoin
- Demos of Filecoin apps
- Workshops specializing in how to build an app on Filecoin
- And more!

In order to apply for this project, please do not use the generic RFP proposal template. Instead, please use the [RFP Community Proposal Template](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/rfp-proposals/rfp-community-proposal-template.md). Please follow the same general instructions as described in the [README for the general RFP proposals](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants#submit-a-proposal-for-an-rfp) (i.e. submit a PR, tag it properly, etc.).

## Value

Community events can be an extremely powerful, galvanizing force for an open-source project. At the same time, we are currently a small set of core project maintainers, and don't have the ability to travel and organize high-quality community events for our global communities. We would love to engage our community members to help in this process, both expanding our global communities and increasing the number of people who are deeply invested in and committed to the success of the Filecoin project.

## Deliverables

- Event logistics plan (including ticket/RSVP link, venue, and schedule of activities + any speakers)
- Summarized post-event report (including what went well at this event, what could have been improved, and feedback from attendees)
- Photos and recordings from the event posted publicly online

## Recommended Team

- Community managers and event organizers would be the perfect fit for this sort of project
- Developers and hackers who are excited about Filecoin and the dweb would also be a great fit!

## Detailed Requirements & Constraints

- Event must be publicly marketed
- Event must have some photos or recording (doesn't need to be extensive, just need some proof that the event occurred as intended)
- Event must be focused on the Filecoin ecosystem
- Team must organize and manage the event themselves
