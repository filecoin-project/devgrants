# Next Step Microgrants

## About

Next Step Microgrants are available to support the next steps of software projects building with Filecoin, IPFS, or related technology. If you have a working prototype and a clear idea of what comes next, consider applying for a microgrant!

Starting January 27, 2023, microgrants will exclusively be awarded for projects within rotating [Microgrant focus areas](#focus-areas). Applications for the most recent focus area, [Filecoin Virtual Machine](https://fvm.filecoin.io/), are currently being processed. 

### Intended Audience
These grants are intended for independent developers, small studios, non-profits, activists, researchers... and you! 

### Award
After a microgrant is approved, Protocol Labs will make an initial payment valued at $1,000 USD to one single Filecoin wallet address. The second tranche (valued at $4,000 USD) will be paid out after you have successfully deployed a functional version of your project to Filecoin mainnet or the latest testnet. 
 
 _The entire grant amount will be paid in FIL_ and should be used to support work related to integrating or improving Filecoin, IPFS, or related technology (i.e. developer time, hosting services, relevant hardware, etc.)

### Program Qualifications
Next Step Microgrants are intended to be easy to apply for, evaluate, and administer. Projects must meet the following criteria:

1. You've already built a working prototype with Filecoin (or closely related technologies such as IPFS, IPLD, libp2p, or frameworks or services such as NFT.storage, Textile Powergate, etc.), independently or as part of a course or hackathon.
2. Your project fits the current [focus area](#focus-areas).
3. You can provide a clear and straightforward description of the _Next Step_ you plan to take with grant support.
4. You can complete this work within 3 months. 
5. You agree to open-source this work, via MIT license for code or [CC-BY-SA 3.0](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVreNvKsQmQZ83T86cWSjPu2vR3yZHGPm5jnxFuunEB9u) license for content.
6. You agree to write a monthly update for your project (via a comment on the Github issue for your application). The final update (at 3 months or project completion, whichever comes sooner) should include the results of your microgrant-funded work, a summary of its users or community members, and a description of your experience building on Filecoin, IPFS, and related technology, including any challenges or shortcomings encountered.

When evaluating your proposal, we will consider creativity, potential impact, technical accomplishment, feasibility, and design. Selected applicants may also be contacted about promoting their work results on [the Filecoin Blog](https://blog.filecoin.io/) or social media.

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>My project publishes data or files to IPFS, does it qualify?</summary>
 
Yes, so long as your project aligns with the current [Microgrant focus areas](#focus-areas)
</details>
  
* Q: My project publishes data or files to IPFS, does it qualify?**
  * A: Yes, so long as your project aligns with the current [Microgrant focus areas](#focus-areas)

* Q: My project uses OrbitDB, Textile, nft.storage, or other framework or service, not IPFS directly. Does it qualify?
  * A: Yes, so long as your project aligns with the current [Microgrant focus areas](#focus-areas)

* Q: My project saves data to, or retrieves data from the Filecoin network, does it qualify?
  * A: Yes, so long as your project aligns with the current [Microgrant focus areas](#focus-areas)

* Q: Do you pay out in other currencies besides FIL?
  * A: No

* Q: Should I send the payment information and W8/9 forms to you over email?
  * A: No. We will reply to selected grantees with a form to submit that information.

* Q: Which Filecoin wallet should I use?
  * A: Any valid Filecoin address can be used. You can read more about Filecoin wallets [in the documentation](https://docs.filecoin.io/reference/#wallets). We are not responsible for any use of the FIL once the deposit has been made to the wallet address you provided.

* Q: When is the Filecoin payment made, at what price, and will I be notified?
  * A: Protocol Labs processes Filecoin payments twice a month and there is a short validation period for transactions. An estimated delivery date can be found in the portal used to submit your payment request. Please feel welcome to contact us at grants@filecoin.org if your payment is not received within 30 days. 

* Q: Can someone join the team who was not part of the original hackathon? Or can I switch with someone? Or can only a subset of the original team still participate?
  * A: Yes! All team permutations are ok as long as there is only one submission per original hackathon project.

* Q: What if my "next step" is significantly different from the original project? Can I apply for multiple "next step" grants?
  * A: Next Step Microgrants are intended to build upon prior work. If you're unsure, go ahead and [apply](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/new?assignees=mishmosh&labels=type%3Amicrogrant&template=microgrant.md&title=Next+Step+Microgrant%3A+%3CYour+Title+Here%3E), but add a section explaining the situation with links to any prior grant applications or code. We will review on a case-by-case basis. In some cases, we will recommend that you apply for an [Open Grant](/open-grants/) instead.

* Q: I'm not a coding participant; I coordinated or made videos or helped in other ways. Am I eligible?
  * A: YES! In real life, successful products are the result of many roles, skills, backgrounds and disciplines... not just coding. You are an INSTRUMENTAL part of your team, and are eligible to receive the grant as well.

* Q: What if we don't finish the work and run off with the money?
  * A: Please contact our team immediately. We may be able to help with certain project hurdles and can discuss an updated timeline.
