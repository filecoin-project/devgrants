# Open Grant Proposal: `NFT Gallery`

**Name of Project:** `NFT Gallery`

**Proposal Category:** `app-dev`

**Proposer:** `froid1911`

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** `YES`

# Project Description

We recognized that there is right now no good solution to organize your NFTs in Galleries and display them whereever you want - in a self soverign way.
Consider checking into a Hotel and your NFTs are already there or display specific NFT on your TV @ Home, at your  Meeting room or somewhere else.

This project aims to bring **your NFTs next to you**. In order to reach this goal we adopt the identity protocol for open applications **idx.xyz** which relies on the general open information protocol **ceramic.network** which again relies on **ipfs** as Hot Storage and Communication Layer.

In our product the user can use its Social Login to enter our App sort its NFTs in Galleries and later display those in any screen with Internet Connection.

Right now  we want to user Textile Powergate as Cold Storage solution. Alternativly Filswan could be an option.
## Value 

With our solution we show how Web3 Dapps look and feel.
Additionally it brings the already existing 50.000 Users vom IDX to Filecoin.

Right now we can not identify any product oriented risks, except NFTs identifies itself as a totally scam.

## Deliverables

The final product will be a fully functional web application hosted on IPFS.
Cold Storage will be provided through a Serverless function and a Textile Powergate.

## Development Roadmap

### 1. UI/UX Design and Implementation

Good UX/UI takes time. In order to avoid pitfalls and get realworld customer feedback. We create a design in one day and ask friends in the nft space for feedback. We iterate for one week over and over and come up with a good design at the end of the week.

Afterwards it needs to implemented, which will take three weeks in order to finish the common components: BaseLayout, LoginComponent, ProfileComponent, ProfileEditComponent, OwnedNFTsComponent, CreateGalleryComponent, GalleryListComponent, GalleryEditComponent and GalleryShowComponent.

When the App is started it loads the BaseLayout. 

In case the user is already logged in it shows the Profile in the Header Menu of the BaseLayout and in the Body the OwnedNFTsComponent and the GalleryListComponent. Through Drag and Drop it should be possible to put NFTs in a gallery. Additionally a settings Buttons allows to edit specific settings of the gallery in the GalleryEditComponent. Each Gallery has also a directlink to a presentation mode GalleryShowComponent where the gallery is presented with the NFTs and the settings from the GalleryEditComponent, e.g. a specific slide show or specific stop intervals.

In case the user is not logged in, the BaseLayout shows a Login Button in the Body instead of owned NFTs and identity related galleries.
The functionality for the login button will be implemented in milestone 2

Stories:
   - Create Design in Figma
   - Setup Git Repository with ReactApp and Bootstrap
   - Implement evaluated design in proposed components

People: Frank (Design) + Rene (Dev)
Timeline: 1 month, July 1st - August 1st
Funding: USD 10000

### IDX, Ceramic and IPFS as Social Login

With this milestone we delivers the ability to log into the app through the LoginComponent which executes the login method from the IDX Framework and use Metamask as Signing Provider. After the login the app loads the Basic Profile from IDX. In case the user has no existung Profile, the ProfileEditComponent shows up as Modal allows to create and persist a Profile on IPFS through IDX and ceramic.

We rely on the SDKs of IDX, Ceramic,IPFS and the Metamask Web3 Provider in order to archieve our Web3 DID Login. This allows us to fetch the Ethereum Address of the user. Thereby we can load the user owned NFTs from the OpenSea API.

If a gallery is created or edited the gallery will be stored on IPFS through IDX and Ceramic. 

Stories:
   - Provide IDXLogin Functionality with Metamask, Ceramic and IPFS
   - Provide Extended NFT Gallery Schema for Ceramic Network
   - Store Galleries after creation or edit in IPFS 

Dev Team (Pair): Frank
Timeline: 2 weeks, July 14th - July 31th
Funding:  USD 5000

### 3. Filecoin as Cold Storage 

In order to provide long term storage or cold storage for galleries we need to provide a feature which allows the user to persist entire galleries on Filecoin. Right now almost every web3 user has a Metamask wallet, but not every user has FIL Wallet in the browser. Therefore we provide a Textile Powergate which creates for every NFT User an Account and provide some FIL to persist Galleries long term.

Later on we want a more decentralized version of that where ideally the user comes with own FIL Provider.

The feature is for the user optional and is easy to trigger through a checkbox or a button.

Stories:
   - Setup Powergate
   - Provide Serverless function to create and fund NFT Gallery Users with FIL
   - Implement Cold Storage Feature for NFT Galleries in React App

Dev Team (Pair): Frank (Powergate, Frontend) + Rene (Backend)
Timeline: 1 month, August 1st - August 31th
Funding:  USD 10000

## Total Budget Requested

We request USD 25000.

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

After we launch, we will go on and build a product. Because of protocol changes we will probably never have a final version.
Therefore at some time we'll plan an exit to community.
