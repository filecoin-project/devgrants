# Open Grant Proposal: distributed market documentation

**Name of Project:** distributed market documentation automation

**Proposal Category:** Choose one of `app-dev`

**Proposer:** brianebert

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** Yes

# Project Description

Marketplaces comprise significant use of the internet.  Decentralized exchanges offer advantages, such as maintaining custody of one's funds while trading, and the ability to trade assets an exchange is not prepared to process.  Unless a token trading has already become well known, discovering what a given offer signifies can be arduos and error prone.  Neither is it easy for a token issuer to link information about their offer to an asset being traded.

To address those issues I write documentation pertaining to tokens trading on a blockchain into IPFS.  Required documentation of the token includes its unique offer ID.  The IPFS hash is written indellibly with a signed blockchain transaction which enters the offer into the exchange.   A similar operation binds statements of identity, also stored in IPFS, to public keys, thus binding identifyinh documents of both market participants and wares.  The process is very simple for users, promising use of distributed exchanges for transaction in a wide variety of goods and services.

While I link self authenticating documents indelibly with market offers, buyers and sellers, the storage of the data depends upon entrepreneurs getting storage offers to market participants.  I will integrate a lotus server with the IPFS node I run, seeking storage deals for market users' documents.

## Value

Expansion of distributed exchanges from tokens to tokenized general goods and services explodes available markets, growing storage requirements with each transaction.  Filecoin uptake among marketplaces, social networks, and other service providers will homologate the experience of sharing data while remaining in control of it.  Leaving data siloed among service providers threatens one rational for a distributed web.

## Deliverables

Deliverable 1: A user interface enabling description document storage bound to buy or sell offers.
Deliverable 2: Colocated lotus server requesting storage offers and executing available deals.
Deliverable 3: Revision of user experience based on learnings in 1 & 2, striving for easy entry agreements.

## Development Roadmap

I'm sorry, but this is too much to ask at this stage.

# Additional Information

I serve everything I mention out of IPFS.  I'm not ready to live in the wild yet.  If you ask I'll show you everything operating.
