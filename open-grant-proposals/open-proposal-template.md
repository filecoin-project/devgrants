# Project Description

Marketplaces constiture a significant use of the internet.  Decentralized exchanges offer advantages, such as maintaining custody of one's funds while trading, and the ability to trade assets an exchange is not prepared to process.  Unless a token trading has already become well known, discovering what a given offer signifies can be arduos and error prone.  Neither is it easy for a token issuer to link information about their offer to an asset being traded.  I solve this problem.

I write documentation pertaining to tokens trading on blockchain into IPFS.  Required documentation of the token includes its unique offer.  The IPFS hash is written indellibly into the memo field of the signed blockchain transaction which enters the offer into the exchange.   A similar operation binds statements of identity, also stored in IPFS, to public keys, thus automating identification of market participants and wares.  The process is very simple for users, promising use of distributed exchanges for transaction in a wide variety of goods and services.

While I link self authenticating documents indelibly with market offers, buyers and sellers, the storage of the data depends upon entrepreneurs getting storage offers to market participants.  I would like to replace my IPFS node with a filecoin node and draw storage offers from the open market.

## Value

Expansion of distributed exchanges from tokens to automatically tokenized general goods and services to explodes the served market, and thus storage requirements.  Filecoin uptake among marketplaces, social networks, and other service providers will homologate the user's experience of sharing their data while remaining in control of it.  Leaving them with data siloed among service providers threatens one rational for a distributed web.

## Deliverables

Deliverable 1: A market user interface enabling description storage, and offer to sell or buy for bespoke tokens running on IPFS
Deliverable 2: A version of 1 storing user data in a filecoin repo
Deliverable 3: Augmentation of user experience to include easy entry into filecoin storage agreements.

## Development Roadmap

I'm sorry, but this is too much to ask at this stage.

## Total Budget Requested

Deliverable Time(mo) Cost($K)
  1             1       5
  2             1       5
  3             2       10

Here's a wannabe wysiwig text editor that generages html, which I've integrated to an IPFS backend:

# Additional Information

I serve everything I mention out of IPFS.  I'm not ready to let it out into the wild yet, but if you ask to see it running I can show you.
