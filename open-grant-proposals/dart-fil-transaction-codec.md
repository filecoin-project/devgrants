# Open Grant Proposal: `Dart FIL Transaction Codec`

**Name of Project:** dart-fil-transaction-codec

**Proposal Category:** `devtools-libraries`

**Proposer:** [@nbltrust](https://github.com/nbltrust)

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** YES

# Project Description

A Dart implementation of transaction codec for filecoin, which could parse and build FIL transaction. We are building a wallet app called [**Jade Wallet**](https://www.jadewallet.io/) which will support FIL, this project is a component of it.

**Jade Wallet** is making a new paradigm of self-custody, which uses **multi-party computation (MPC)** and **threshold signature scheme (TSS)** technology. **MPC based Threshold Signatures** gives clients total autonomy over whose digital assets and multisignature ability with keyless cryptographic security.

We are building **Jade Wallet** with Flutter, so we do a Dart implementation. For some business reason, **Jade Wallet** is not suitable to be open source. But we still want to contribute the filecoin developer community.

## Value

Flutter allows you to develop a cross-platform application for every operating system with the need of one codebase. In contrast, native apps require application-specific coding for each platform separately and increase the cost of development. The project will benefit who want to develop wallet apps which support FIL, it reduces the development cost. We think filecoin ecosystem will grow bigger and bigger, and wallet apps are the entrance to the blockchain world.
