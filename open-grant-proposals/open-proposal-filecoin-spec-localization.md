# Open Grant Proposal : `Filecoin Spec Localization`

**Name of Project :**  Filecoin Spec Localization

**Proposal Category :**  docs

**Proposer :** [@maobisheng](github.com/maobisheng)

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses? :** Yes 

# Project Description

Our team feels that it is necessary to create a Chinese version of the Filecoin Spec. In addition, we also plan to generate 
multilingual versions of `filecoin-project-specs`, including but not limited to Chinese and English.
## Value

We find that Chinese miners and researchers account for the majority of the filecoin market, and most of them cannot 
fully understand the `Filecoin Specification` due to their inadequate English proficiency. Chinese developers are often distressed by some 
simple theoretical knowledge, which is shown in slack and other communities. We always see Chinese users asking 
questions that can be easily found in the Spec. 

## Deliverables

- Adding a language toggle button to the Spec page
- Adding language packs for the source code of `filecoin-project-specs`

## Budget

All for basic cost : $1000

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

We would focus on the Filecoin Spec updates in real time and make changes accordingly.

## Relevant Experience

Our team has been focusing on Filecoin's mining testing, specification studies, problem submission, and code 
contributions. 

Our developers have been reading block chain English documents for years and paying close attention to the source
code, specification and implementation of Filecoin research. 

## Team Translation Example

# Additional Information

Our translation of technical terms will be more accurate since we most fully understand the terminology of the Filecoin.
