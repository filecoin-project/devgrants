# Project Description

Our project will contribute to the critical need for user-friendly storage applications built on top of Filecoin, specifically ones that are dialed-in for the non-trivial needs of the libraries, archives, and museums that preserve the world’s cultural heritage. The digital preservation communities of practice within cultural heritage are the ideal adopters of Filecoin – their standards for demonstrable file authenticity, redundancy, and backups are immense. Even major institutions can struggle to meet digital preservation standards, and we see Filecoin as having great potential to help these communities better meet these goals – but it can only do so if there are applications that meet their expectations and requirements.

Our team has already begun to meet this need by leading the development of [Starling](http://starlingstorage.io/), a proof-of-concept storage application for Filecoin. In our last round of development we conducted a very small batch of usability testing with ideal early adopter users that come from the library, archive, and museum sectors – and we detailed [eight key insights from this testing in a detailed report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q_rBpBsWm-zJZ4Q1e5CYtQVa5hqqpaArn5kp4dX8qx0/edit?usp=sharing). This initial round of testing was deeply informative – although our team is already deeply immersed in the cultural heritage community, we learned so much through putting the software in the hands of potential users. Aside from the specific product insights that were gained, we also gained the broader insight that in order to build a user-friendly storage application powered by Filecoin, we must delve deeper into more extensive usability testing.

We propose to conduct a focused round of in-depth usability tests of the Starling command-line interface. This will ultimately result in a report that gives a crystal clear map of the needs, wants, and desires of users within the library, archive, and museum sectors with regards to a storage application powered by Filecoin. Gaining these insights are critical to gain before any further software development happens with Starling, to be sure we are building the tool that library, archives, and museum workers want and need. 

## Value

Our first round of user testing revealed that even with our best-effort to build a product that is guessable, user-friendly, and inviting, that we carried a decent amount of bias over from the Filecoin world – re-using terminology, concepts, and interactions that end-users would not be familiar with. Delving deeper into the expectations of the cultural heritage community will ensure that our next round of development on Starling will push the product in a direction that drives broad adoption of Starling, and thus, Filecoin.
 
Furthermore, we are confident that the insights and results of our user testing will be immensely valuable to the broader Filecoin storage application development community. During the inaugural Filecoin storage application development show & tell, we asked our peers how we could best contribute to their work, and they clearly stated that openly publish our user research would be at the top of their list. 
 
The only palpable risk for this project is user recruitment for testing – we are living in an uncertain time with the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on the library, archive, and museum world has been significant. We are confident that we will be able to attract more than enough users for testing, but there may indeed be certain ideal users we have in mind that may be unavailable due to the current circumstances.


## Deliverables

Our project has one key deliverable, and that is a detailed report that provides both a high level view of our findings, as well as an in-depth analysis of the macro issues, and insights into our users needs and behaviours, culminating in a vision for what an ideal Filecoin storage application for the cultural heritage community looks like.

## Development Roadmap

1. Test design: the quality of the insights gained through usability testing are of course only as good as the test that was designed to bring them to light. Our team will carefully craft a moderated usability test that seeks to build upon the insights gained during our initial round of testing.
- Staff: Ben Fino-Radin, test design; Erin Barsan, test design assistance 
- Timeline: May 4st - May 15th
- Costs: $8,000 fee

2. User recruitment: We will recruit users across three segments – libraries, archives, and museums. Will will recruit between 3-5 users per segment, ensuring a diverse range of demographics, including technical expertise.
- Staff: Erin Barsan, user recruitment communications
- Timeline: May 11th - May 22nd
- Costs $325 for user thank-you gifts ($25 gift card per user), and $2,000 fee – $2,325 total

3. Test environment setup:  We will arrange technical logistics for test environment setup, ensuring a VM has been set up with Filecoin and Starling pre-installed, with easy access for testers, and ideal real-world test data.
- Staff: Ben Fino-Radin, test environment technical setup; Erin Barsan, test environment test-driving
- Timeline: May 11th - May 22nd
- Costs: $200 hosting costs and $3,000 fee, $3,200 total

4. Test moderation: We will lead all users through a moderated usability test, ensuring consistency, and high quality results, each session will be recorded via screen and webcam capture, documenting the user’s actions and emotions.
- Staff: Erin Barsan, test moderation
- Timeline: May 25th - June 5th
- Costs: $8,000 fee

5. Test data gathering: We will review the test recordings, logging key issues, challenges, bugs, or positive outcomes encountered by users, as well as anecdotal comments made by users. This will form the basis for our ultimate deliverable. 
- Staff: Erin Barsan, data gathering; Ben Fino-Radin data gathering oversight
- Timeline: May 25th - June 12th
- Costs: $8,000 fee

6. Insight report creation: Our team will sift and sort through the data gathered from the tests, derive broader insights, and develop recommended actions. This will culminate in the form of a report analogous in format to our [past work](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q_rBpBsWm-zJZ4Q1e5CYtQVa5hqqpaArn5kp4dX8qx0/edit?usp=sharing).
- Staff: Ben Fino-Radin, insight development; Erin Barsan, report production
- Timeline: June 15th - July 3rd
- Costs: $19,000 fee

## Total Budget Requested

$48,525

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

As our deliverable is research and a report, software development maintinance and upgrade questions are of course not as relevant. Our report will be published openly on the Filecoin GitHub, on Small Data’s website, on the Starling website, and as a Google Slides link.

## Relevant Experience

The two most obvious characteristics of our team and our past work that qualify us for leading this project are: that we led the design and development of Starling, and have already conducted a successful usability study on the product. Beyond this however, Small Data Industries is incredibly uniquely positioned to lead storage application design and development in the Filecoin community. Not only do we deeply understand the potential of Filecoin and the ins-and-outs of building on top of decentralized storage, but we are also deeply connected to the library, archive, and museum communities. We are well positioned to connect with our colleagues in these fields and bring the potential of Filecoin to them.
 
We have worked with cultural heritage institutions all over the world on digital preservation infrastructure projects – including but not limited to: The Whitney Museum of American Art, The Australian center for the Moving Image, The Art Gallery of Ontario, The Art Institute of Chicago, M+ Museum in Hong Kong, and the Haus der Elektronischen Künste in Basel – just to name a few.
 
Small Data’s work has been presented numerous times at the annual Library of Congress Storage Architectures meeting, the American Institute for Conservation, the Preservation and Archiving Special Interests Group, the Art Library Society of North America, the Association of Moving Image Archivists, the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Institute of Fine Arts, and the Christie’s Art + Tech Summit.
 
Prior to establishing Small Data Industries in 2017, Ben Fino-Radin served as the Associate Media Conservator at the Museum of Modern Art, and Digital Conservator at Rhizome. He holds Masters degrees in Library and Information Science, and Digital Art from Pratt Institute.
 
Erin Barsan heads up all Archives and Collections Information projects at Small Data Industries. Prior to joining Small Data in 2018, Erin held positions at the Minneapolis Institute of Art, and the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art.
