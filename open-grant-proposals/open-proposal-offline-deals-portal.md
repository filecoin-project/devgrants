# Project Description

As a slingshot participant, I started with online deals only but the success rate is not ideal. Many transfer errors. Therefore in phase 2.3 I start to organize a lot offline deals with many different people on slack, verified and unverified. 

As time goes by it's getting harder and harder to track who got my CAR files, who I have proposed deals with and whats their status now. With verified deals it adds complication of how much datacap is left.

I am hoping by creating this portal, various client and provider (a.k.a. miner) can collaborate on it and solve these pain points.

## Value

Allow a much smoother offline deal making process. Without it, people will have to manually manage them in slack and excel sheet.

## Deliverables

This portal will allow both client and provider to login using multiple social logins, and allow them to streamline offline deal making process.

# Client's use case:
1. Create file batches, including their filenames, commP and absolute path (mailed in hard drives) or download link (online download).
2. Send batch to provider.
3. Phase 1: make deals manually and upload CSV of Deal_CID into portal.
   Phase 2: allow direct deal making through portal by registering daemon API address and auth info.
4. Track deal status.

# Provider's use case:
1. Enter basic information like minerID, geolocation and sealing ability.
2. Accept batches from client.
3. Notify client if the batch is fully received / downloaded.
4. Track deal status.
5. Phase 2: allow direct import through portal by registering miner API address and auth info.
