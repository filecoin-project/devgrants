**Name of Project: Opscientia - proposal for research and technical design into hosting large neuroscience datasets on IPFS**

**Proposal Category:** `technical-design`

**Proposer:** `XandraMcC`

# Project Description

<!-- - Start with the need or problem you are trying to solve with this project.
- Describe why your solution is going to adequately solve this problem. -->

Our team were ETHGlobal Web3Weekend finalists with our Open Science (Opsci) Data Wallet. We also won the Textile.io prize and IPFS blog recognised us as a project that most inspired them. This proposal is to carry on with this idea and research the backend of how we would handle large terabytes of data on IPFS and how we can integrate that into our data wallet.

We are partnering with DANDI (Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration) at MIT which is funded by the US government BRAIN initiative (set up by the Obama administration) to test if IPFS can successfully support 2.5 terabytes of brain data. This data is currently non-human and is stored centrally on AWS. However, when human brain data starts being collected by DANDI, and other neuroscience laboratories, there is an inherent ethical risk of storing human data with Big Tech companies. This is where decentralised data storage comes in and we would like to work with IPFS to help verify and build a solution that helps scientists to store their data in an ethical manner.

Milestones for this project:
1. Build on initial user-research with users (neuroscientists)
2. Validate and design the backend of our data wallet to be able to host large datasets
3. Build permission management v1
4. User-requirement design
5. Validate permission management v1 with users (neuroscientists)

## Value

<!-- Please describe in more detail why this proposal is valuable for the Filecoin ecosystem. Answer the following questions:
- What are the benefits to getting this right?
- What are the risks if you don't get it right?
- What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult?

This section should be 1-3 paragraphs long. -->

## Deliverables

<!-- Please describe in details what your final deliverable for this project will be. Include a specification of the project and what functionality the software will deliver when it is finished. -->

At the end of these 6 weeks we will have a much clearer view on the technical design of 

- Permission management v1 built & validated by users
- Feature requirements and future product design

## Development Roadmap

<!-- Please break up your development work into a clear set of milestones. This section needs to be very detailed (will vary on the project, but aim for around 2 pages for this section).

For each milestone, please describe:
- The software functionality that we can expect after the completion of each milestone. This should be detailed enough that it can be used to ensure that the software meets the specification you outlined in the Deliverables.
- How many people will be working on each milestone and their roles
- The amount of funding required for each milestone
- How much time this milestone will take to achieve (using real dates) -->
