# Project Description

Please describe exactly what you are planning to build. Make sure to include the following:
- Start with the need or problem you are trying to solve with this project.
- Describe why your solution is going to adequately solve this problem.

This section should be 2-3 paragraphs long.

Our team were ETHGlobal Web3Weekend finalists with our Open Science (Opsci) Data Wallet. We also won the Textile.io prize and IPFS blog recognised us as a project that inspired them. This proposal is to carry on with this idea and research the backend of how we would handle large TB's of data on the backed on IPFS. We are partnering with DANDI (Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration) at MIT which is funded by the US government BRAIN initiative (set up by the Obama administration) to test 2.5 TB's of brain data. This data is currently non-human and is stored centrally on AWS however, the issue is that when human brain data starts being collected there is a danger of storing this with Big Tech companies and that is where the importance of decentralised data storage comes in.

Through this project we would like to validate and design the backend of our data wallet to be able to host large datasets and be able to ensure data persistence, ...

## Value

Please describe in more detail why this proposal is valuable for the Filecoin ecosystem. Answer the following questions:
- What are the benefits to getting this right?
- What are the risks if you don't get it right?
- What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult?

This section should be 1-3 paragraphs long.

## Deliverables

Please describe in details what your final deliverable for this project will be. Include a specification of the project and what functionality the software will deliver when it is finished.

## Development Roadmap

Please break up your development work into a clear set of milestones. This section needs to be very detailed (will vary on the project, but aim for around 2 pages for this section).

For each milestone, please describe:
- The software functionality that we can expect after the completion of each milestone. This should be detailed enough that it can be used to ensure that the software meets the specification you outlined in the Deliverables.
- How many people will be working on each milestone and their roles
- The amount of funding required for each milestone
- How much time this milestone will take to achieve (using real dates)

## Total Budget Requested

Sum up the total requested budget across all milestones, and include that figure here. Also, please include a budget breakdown to specify how you are planning to spend these funds.

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

Specify your team's long-term plans to maintain this software and upgrade it over time.
