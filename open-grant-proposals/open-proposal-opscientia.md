**Name of Project: Opscientia - proposal for research and technical design into hosting large neuroscience datasets on IPFS**

**Proposal Category:** Choose one of `technical-design`

**Proposer:** `XandraMcC`

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** Yes

# Project Description

- Start with the need or problem you are trying to solve with this project.
- Describe why your solution is going to adequately solve this problem.

Our team were ETHGlobal Web3Weekend finalists with our Open Science (Opsci) Data Wallet. We also won the Textile.io prize and IPFS blog recognised us as a project that most inspired them. This proposal is to carry on with this idea and research the backend of how we would handle large TB's of data on IPFS and how we can integrate that into our data wallet.

We are partnering with DANDI (Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration) at MIT which is funded by the US government BRAIN initiative (set up by the Obama administration) to test if IPFS can successfully support 2.5 TB's of brain data. This data is currently non-human and is stored centrally on AWS. However, when human brain data starts being collected by DANDI, and other neuroscience labratories, there is an inherent ethical risk of storing human data with Big Tech companies. This is where decentralised data storage comes in and we would like to would with IPFS to help verify and build a solution that helps scientists to store their data in an ethical manner.

Milestones for this project:
1. Build on initial user-research with users (neuroscientists)
2. Validate and design the backend of our data wallet to be able to host large datasets
3. Build proof-of-concept
4. Validate proof-of-concept with users (neuroscientists)

## Value

Please describe in more detail why this proposal is valuable for the Filecoin ecosystem. Answer the following questions:
- What are the benefits to getting this right?
- What are the risks if you don't get it right?
- What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult?

This section should be 1-3 paragraphs long.

## Deliverables

Please describe in details what your final deliverable for this project will be. Include a specification of the project and what functionality the software will deliver when it is finished.

## Development Roadmap

Please break up your development work into a clear set of milestones. This section needs to be very detailed (will vary on the project, but aim for around 2 pages for this section).

For each milestone, please describe:
- The software functionality that we can expect after the completion of each milestone. This should be detailed enough that it can be used to ensure that the software meets the specification you outlined in the Deliverables.
- How many people will be working on each milestone and their roles
- The amount of funding required for each milestone
- How much time this milestone will take to achieve (using real dates)

### Final outcome
