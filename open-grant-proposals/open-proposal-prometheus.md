# Open Grant Proposal: `Prometheus`

**Name of Project:** Prometheus

**Proposal Category:**  `docs and app-dev`

**Proposer:** `fireseeds`

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** `Yes`

# Project Description

As we could imagine Filecoin contents will keep increasing as the project grows over time, but there is no good place to list out those community contributions and project ecosystem information such as content creation, community project, grants, tooling, etc..

With that, we propose to create a community-driven ecosystem website which would start with few contributors to build up the first prototype that aims to be a community one-stop shop which would contain everything about the Filecoin community activities, (Tutorial, Applications)content creation written by the community, toolings, workshop and grants information. And the final goal is to have an incentive scheme governed by DAO to let the community manage it autonomously to further decentralised the project.

# Value

- What are the benefits to getting this right?

It would be the place for everyone to get started with Filecoin and easily understand the whole Filecoin ecosystem in the first glace. The public can easily navigate what kind of projects/tooling is exists. On the other hand, the community can also directly contribute to the website by participating in content creation, writing tutorial or sample application that makes the whole project becomes more community-driven and decentralised.

- What are the risks if you don't get it right?

The only risk might be the translation is not accurate, or the information has not kept up-to-date as the documentation might keep changing since the project is still in the early stage. Yet, it can be resolved by inviting more professional people or community to get involved and keep it evolve over time. 

- What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult?

From the technical perspective, Filecoin JS API is not available yet so that means it might not be possible to work on the faucet before JS API get released, and that is the main reason why it has been put it to milestone 2.

Unchained Labs has a wide range of blockchain and full-stack development experience. Maggie first worked as the core dev in [EvolutionLand](https://www.github.com/evolutionlandorg), a virtual management game on Ethereum that comprises about 100 contracts. Then as the lead dev of [Darwinia network](https://www.darwinia.network) focused on the fundamental cross-chain framework, implemented eth-bridge on [Substrate](http://parity.io/substrate/). Now, is an engineer at [Parity Technologies](https://parity.io), aiming at dev education around Asia. While Anson is work for technical education at [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/), which responsible for content creation such as [writing tutorials](https://wiki.polkadot.network/), sample applications, and hosting different workshops about Polkadot. And he worked as a Hyperledger fabic blockchain developer at IBM Hong Kong ltd to deliver [enterprise solutions](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2017/11/first-blockchain-based-bancassurance-network-launched-in-hong-kong/) previously.
