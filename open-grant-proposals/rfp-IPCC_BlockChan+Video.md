# RFP:  `IPCC BlockChain+Video Platform`

**Name of Project:** BlockChain+Video Platform

**RFP Category:** app-dev

**Proposer:** ipc_earth@outlook.com

## Project Description

Project `IPCC BlockChain +Video Platform` is one of the major projects IPCC (Interplanetary Cloud Communication Co.Ltd.) is going to develop and delivery to business in 2021, +Video project is based on Filecoin&Blockchain framework which aimed to solve the painpoints of current popular video platforms in following aspects:
- Intellectual property right is hard to be protected in public internet platforms
- Highly Increased capital expenditures in date storage and sharing is difficult to be controlled 
- Untrustworthy interactive data publishing increases the risks in stakeholders relationship and initiatives.

IPCC +Video Platform is technically based on following sub-systems:
- Ally Chain, which provides the high performance and low-cost for groups of private Filecoin nodes, mainly based on the authentication and authorization technologies in Filecoin Ecosystem
- Decentralized Storage, which mainly developed on the basis of IPFS technologies
- Decentralized Application, which aligning with public and IPFS CDN technologies to distribute our high performance data sharing, storing and accessing service for public end-point subscribers

## Value

Based on `IPCC BlockChain +Video Platform`, the following values will be contributed to Filecoin ecosystem effectively and efficiently:
1. More people and communities will recognize that the Filecoin ecosystem based technologies and mechanism can effectively solve the intellectual property protection problems for many mainstream internet service providers, like video platforms. Besides, the IPFS  based storage technologies can largely cut-down the infrastructure investment for content-intensive business organizations.
2. +Video project is also a meaningful trial for the technical alignments between blockchain, Filecoin,IPFS, and internet video application domain, its success could also be a milestone in Filecoin ecosystem application, especially in video domain. 
3. If the IPCC +video platform succeeded in business in following years, dozen of valid and meaningful data in ZB unit will be created, stored, and accessed in Filecoin networking, and serve billions of subscribers as well.


## Deliverables

The full scaled system functionalities and sub-systems are as following:
- Node management, including functionalities of Filecoin&IPFS node management, node access authentication and authorization, resource indexing and so on; 
- Resource management, including functionalities of resource store, remove(IPFS), indexing, statistic and intelligent analysis and so on, mainly videoes, profile photoes, and text based resources;
- User administrator management, including User/User-group authentication, authorization, and accounting, user behaviour/activity statistics and analysis; 

The user view/access layer will be based on the devices of:
- Mobile devices (Original Apps, Client/Server based)
- Personal computers (Browser/Server based)

The project will be delivered under the constraints of:
- Time schedule, the planed stages with the milestone check-points will be achieved and delivered according to the defined time base line
- Quality control, the QA team align with program team will regularly test, check, review the product delivery outputs, correct, fix and optimize the possible problems
- Code control, the program team will regularly check the coding outputs according to an iterative mechanism
- Implementation control, OM&Implementation team will deploy and maintain the infrastructure and application system to trial, product environment separately, to provide a stable and resilient product platform for each team member and vendor.
