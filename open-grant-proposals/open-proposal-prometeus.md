# Open Grant Proposal: `Prometeus`

**Name of Project:** Prometeus

**Proposal Category:**  `app-dev`

**Proposer:** `ilyk`

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** Yes

# Project Description

Prometeus is a decentralized and secure marketplace to buy/sell personal data to/from 3rd parties. Prometeus is going to utilize FileCoin as a distributed data storage by adding another layer of data encryption and a marketplace to buy/sell data for Insurance, Influencer Marketing and Medical data market industries.

There is no secure and decentralized data marketplace solution in the market yet, so we expect that sellers and buyers of the data will take an interest in the product.

## Value

Prometeus is valuable for FileCoin because it implements a data encryption and a data marketplace: use-case scenarios that are new for FileCoin. That will increase the number of StorageMiners so it supports the growth of FileCoin network and adds a new encryption layer that is not available now in FileCoin ecosystem.

### What are the benefits to getting this right?

Prometeus is utilizing FileCoin as a distributed file storage and FileCoin StorageMiner count also increases with Prometeus. FileCoin does not have data encryption at the moment and Prometeus is adding a unique and totally new data encryption layer on FileCoin.

### What are the risks if you don't get it right?

For FileCoin risks are low because grant budget is paid on milestone basis and each milestone has its own deliverables. Actually, each milestone is a micro-product itself. 

### What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult?

There are no such operations as file deletion on-demand and FileCoin deal storage format currently doesn’t support file retrieval by other peers in the network.

## Deliverables

An open-source dual-licensed decentralized data marketplace implementation that will allow selling personal, insurance and medical encrypted data to others. The storage will be built based on the FileCoin.
There will be several elements such as reactive web-service and user mobile applications.

## Development Roadmap

### Milestone 1
Goals:
 1. Create specifications document
     * 2 team members to create architecture and specifications
     * 1 week
     * $1,000

Cost: $1,000

Time: 1 week


### Milestone 2

Goals:
 1. File-splitting. Split files into pieces to fill into the FileCoin data-miner sector
     * 1 Backend developer
     * 1 week
     * $2,000
 2. Token-Swap. Automatically exchanger between PROM tokens (which is used inside the Prometeus ecosystem) and FIL in both ways.
     * 1 Backend developer
     * 5 weeks
     * $10,000
 3. File uploading and reading from any node of the system
     * 1 Backend developer
     * 2 weeks
     * $4,000

Cost: 16,000

Time: 5 weeks

### Milestone 3

Goals:
 1. File removal and money-back. The system should be able to remove a file from the storage if such is requested.
     * 2 Backend developer
     * 3 weeks
     * $12,000
 2. File storage time extension.
     * 1 Backend developer
     * 1 week
     * $2,000

Cost: $14,000

Time: 4 weeks

### Milestone 4

Goals:
 1. Production deployment 
 2. Switching to using the Main network of the FileCoin
 3. QA and bug-fixing
 4. Documentation

Cost: $5,000

Time: 2 weeks

## Total Budget Requested

 * Milestone 1: $1,000
 * Milestone 2: $16,000
 * Milestone 3: $14,000
 * Milestone 4: $5,000

Total: $36,000

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

When the project will be done, it will be open source so community can add new features, it’s decentralized and in this case anyone can run their own node to support the ecosystem. Bugfixes will be done on demand, upgrades will be compatible on the protocol levels with previous version (in case FileCoin will also support backward-compatibility). The project can be downloaded, compiled or even used from the box as is by anyone, we’re going to provide Docker Images ready to run in any environment.
