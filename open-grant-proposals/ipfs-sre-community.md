# Project Description

Since 2004,SRE has evolved to become the industry-leading practice for service reliability.

IPFS SRE is what we get when we treat operations as if it’s a software problem.
IPFS SRE's mission is to protect, provide for, and progress the software and systems behind all of Filecoin’s mining services — hardware assets, computing servers, storage servers, security servers, lotus components, and retrieval Engine, to name just a few — 
with an ever-watchful eye on Filecoin Mining's availability, latency, performance, and capacity.

IPFS SRE is a combination not found elsewhere in the industry. 
Like traditional operations groups(http://www.greatops.net/), IPFS SRE keep important, blockchain revenue-critical systems up and running despite hurricanes, bandwidth outages,hardware failure and configuration errors.

The job of IPFS SRE is let the community hear from the big miners describe their experiences as IPFS SREs: how their backgrounds led them to their current roles, what their day-to-day work looks like, and how they've seen the core questions SRE tackles (stability vs. agility, operational work vs. software engineering, proactive vs. reactive work) play out.

Also,one job of IPFS SRE is attracting and advocating new forces from university to join the blockchain SRE community.

## Value

We are buidling a IPFS SRE Community in the Filecoin ecosystem.We found that lots of IPFS investors are from third and fourth tier cities.
They have lots of questions regarding to the Filecoin Mining and IPFS technology. We have consultanted some teams with the zero SRE experiences.

- get the SRE experiences from tradition ops to Filecoin ecosystem and satisfies the DevOps pillars as follows:
  - Reduce organizational silos 
    -SRE shares ownership with developers to create shared responsibility 
    -SREs use the same tools that developers use, and vice versa
  - Accept failure as normal
    - SREs embrace risk 
    - SRE quantifies failure and availability in a prescriptive manner using Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
    - SRE mandates blameless post mortems
  - Implement gradual changes 
    - SRE encourages developers and product owners to move quickly by reducing the cost of failure
  - Leverage tooling and automation 
    - SREs have a charter to automate manual tasks (called "toil") away 
  - Measure everything 
    - SRE defines prescriptive ways to measure values
    - SRE fundamentally believes that systems operation is a software problem
- build a discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to Filecoin infrastructure and operations problems.
- incubate the community to create scalable and highly reliable Filecoin mining systems.

## Mode of Operation:
The original idea was to leverage the online podcast platform and offline meetup to spread knowledge and educate more beginner, now we put our thinking of this activities as more systematic approach.

Maybe the proposals could be split into separate applications, but considering the team is going to setup independent neutral entity dedicated to these proposals, the team merge these applications together.

1. setup independent neutral entity in China dedicated in SRE community （ongoing）
2. weekly Tech meetup (10-20ppl attendees,offline,top 4 city) (ongoing)
3. monthly Tech meetup (20-50ppl attendees,offline,top 4 city) (ongoing)
4. meetup with big miners (20-50ppl attendees,offline,miner's office) (todo)
5. meetup with Universities (20-50ppl attendees,offline,university's office) (todo)
6. Annual general meeting & Hackthon on Filecoin SRE (500-1000ppl attendees,offline,Chengdu city) (todo)
7. build and deliver open source SRE tools (1-3ppl engineers,ongoing)
8. SRE book(Filecoin/IPFS/Libp2p) publishing (1-5ppl researchers) (ongoing)
9. building website to collect SRE experiences and knowledge (1-3ppl engineers) (ongoing)

Why online podcast? WeChat is the easiest way to reach community members in China. WeChat Podcast is the new social system built by Tensent.
Causes of the outbreak（COVID-19）, people can't communicate to each other directly.
Here is the plan for the podcast: https://www.kdocs.cn/l/srXkNrCpZAn2
