# Project Description

Looking to build a portal focusing on NFT music artist.

## Value

To echo "Not on IPFS, not your NFT", this platform allows NFT music artist to store their work on filecoin network. 

Each piece of art will have a unique and immutable IPFS address, to prevent rug pull event like https://twitter.com/neitherconfirm/status/1369285946198396928.

## Deliverables

This portal will allow artist login using multiple social logins, and allow them to upload and manage their music art work.

Anonymous visitors can browse / search the NFT catalog and play the music.

The storage of the art pieces will be collaborated with FilSwan platform, utilizing the pool of miners there, hiding the complexity from artist about IPFS/Filecoin.

# Artist's use case:
1. Create / manage NFT collection.
2. Store / manage music art piece in collection.
3. Obtain immutable IFPS address.

# Visitor's use case:
1. Browse NFT collection
2. Search by name, genre, artist, and other metadata about the music.
3. Play the music.
