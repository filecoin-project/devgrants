 # Project Description
Throughout the history of blockchain, wallet has always been an important tool for the transfer in and out of token. In Filecoin , wallet can make token flow faster and more convenient, and improve the flow ability;<br>
FileWallet is a mobile digital crypto wallet that supports filecoin.<br>

This wallet also has the characteristics of distributed, can generate wallet locally in the client without relying on the network and server. At the same time, it is safe enough to encrypt information locally. Users can use FileWallet query balance, authorize, receive and send fil anytime and anywhere,

## Deliverables
1. A mobile wallet, including IOS and Android devices.<br>
-Users can accept and transmit fil<br>
-Support security key management, backup and recovery<br>
-Show network confirmed transactions<br>
2. Use with the filecoin node API (local or remote lotus and go filecoin) to  perform the expected workflow<br>
3. developed by Java and swift<br>
4. has a well-documented, human-readable codebase<br>
5. Open source, dual licensing (under MIT and Apache 2)

## Detailed Requirements & Constraints

### Data to Display
- Users can create wallets on local clients, support secp256k1 and BLS, and can also use HD wallets with multiple addresses in mnemonic seed.<br>

- The wallet does not need to pass through the network, and is encrypted locally. It can guarantee the storage and transfer security of assets by signature encryption technology. It can improve the security of users' assets by combining the backup anti loss mechanism such as mnemonic and keystore;<br>

## Milestones & Funding
**Total Funding Amount:** 16000$<br>
| Milestone No. | Milestone Description | Funding | Milestone No. | 
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | Finalize scope, a list of node API endpoints to be used, workflow design, architectural design & UI mockups | 2000$ | 2-3weeks |
| 2 | Implementation interoperable with a Filecoin node, Wallet can be created and operated | 6000$ | 3-4weeks |
| 3 | Provide toolkit generated by wallet local client for developers. | 2000$ | 1weeks |
| 4 | All project deliverables are completed and added to the Filecoin Shipyard (website, documentation, codebase) | 3000$ | 2weeks |
| 5 | Maintenance and Upgrades during Testnet and Mainnet | 3000$ | 2-3weeks |
- At present, we have begun to launch product prototype planning. In the future, we hope to participate in the official test and build a better user experience based on our previous wallet experience.
## Acceptance Criteria
Milestone 1 involves product manager and UX, and early blockchain engineer and system architect participate in code designing<br>
Milestones 2 and 3, iOS front-end and Android front-end engineers plus system architects participate in code.<br>
Milestones 4 and 5 will involve front-end engineers and system architects.<br>
Filewallet’s goal is to keep normal using during the testnet and mainnet. We have done ERC20 wallet mobile devices. The milestone here includes the delay time caused by all possible upgrades on filecoin. We expect that the project will be completed within 14 weeks after the start of the project.

## Maintain plan
1.Maintain the update of the interface with the Filecoin blockchain, including the whole network information query in the test phase;<br>
2. Upgrade the UI interface of the website;<br>
3. Continuously operate and maintain the server, continuously upgrade the server, and maintain the smooth access of users in testnet and mainnet.<br>
4. Keep API interface and documents updated。<br>

## Relevant Experience
Helmsman is a team dedicated to IPFS and Web3.0. We have been actively involved in the construction of distributed storage ecosystem, and as a miner, we actively participated in the storage function test of filecoin Test stage, invested a lot of equipment for testing, and saved a lot of effective data. At the same time, in the previous official first round trusted settings of filecoin, participate in the test of large storage performance.<br>
We can use my own stable nodes to request data to wallets. We have developed digital crypto wallets. (ERC20). Our team has accumulated rich knowledge and experience (blockchain experience of Ethereum and Bitcoin) on the blockchain at the same time.
