# Open Grant Proposal: `Lighthouse pt.2`

**Name of Project:** Lighthouse Filecoin-Ethereum Cross Chain Infra Project

**Proposal Category:** `App-dev`, `Devtools-libraries`

**Proposer:** `@nandit123`

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** Yes

# Project Description
The Lighthouse project provides a way for Ethereum smart contracts to request Filecoin storage of CIDs in IPFS via Textile.io’s Powergate, which simplifies Filecoin storage workflows from IPFS. Using Lighthouse, Ethereum developers can request verifiable storage of data to Filecoin from Ethereum smart contracts.

Currently Lighthouse smart contract is deployed on Ethereum Testnet with which users can interact via Remix IDE, Truffle Box and a basic website frontend or by running and deploying smart contract and lighthouse node on their own. But still there are some important features like a dapp to interact with, paying for storage through ETH / wrapped FIL, publishing storage status back to ethereum chain that can be key features for a wider acceptance and usability of the project.

## Value

- What are the benefits to getting this right?

The project will be very valuable to the Filecoin ecosystem as it will bring in more developers, projects and users from the Ethereum Ecosystem to the Filecoin network. DeFi and NFT projects building on Ethereum blockchain will directly be able to use the Lighthouse for verifiable and long term storage on the Filecoin Network. 

- What are the risks if you don't get it right?

The project has clear goals and upside for the Filecoin Ecosystem and there doesn’t seem to be any risk involved. Even if there comes one, we will do our best to mitigate that towards the success of the ecosystem.

- What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult?

We have the right experience to build a project like this with the right execution. Some difficulty could be around figuring out the efficient and rightly coupled way to publish the storage status of filecoin deals back to the ethereum blockchain but the good news is that there are multiple approaches in this regard that can be tested with ease.

## Deliverables

- Dapp website with a good UI to interact with the lighthouse node

- Allow the users the ability to pay for filecoin storage directly using ethereum / wrapped FIL

- Module for periodic publishing of the storage status back to the ethereum blockchain

- Open source code

- Testing of various modules of the project

- Documentation and Demos

## Development Roadmap

**Milestone 1: Dapp**

- Dapp to interact with the lighthouse node

- Decent UI / UX for a user to interact with

- Ability for the user to send files for filecoin storage using the Dapp

Estimated Time - 3 weeks, Funding - $4,000

**Milestone 2: Pay for storage via Dapp**

- Allow users to pay for the filecoin storage using Ethereum / Wrapped Filecoin.

- Manage payment using a payable smart contract

Estimated Time - 3 weeks, Funding - $5,000

**Milestone 3: Publish the storage status of a file back to Ethereum and Docs, Demos**

- Periodically publish the storage status of the file back to the ethereum blockchain

- Users can also request the storage status to be published via the dapp interface and smart contract

- Interact with Textile.io’s Powergate to publish the storage status

Estimated Time - 3 weeks, Funding - $6,000

**Milestone 4: Documentation and Demos**

- Proper Documentation

- Articles explaining the project

- Youtube video to explain and demonstrate the project 

- Properly documented Github README

Estimated Time - 1 week, Funding - $3,000

## Total Budget Requested

Total Budget Requested - $18,000

Total Time - 10 weeks, starting as early as 05/24/2021

Funding will be used to pay the team and other expenses that occur to complete the project.

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

The plan is to involve the community to take in feedback during and after the project is built and resolve bug fixes or other issues that anyone faces while using the project and maintain it for the long term.
