# Open Grant Proposal: `Fair web: a video meta-data standard for open marketplaces` 
# proposal-type:open

**Name of Project:** Fair web: a video meta-data standard for open marketplaces

**Proposal Category:** `app-dev`

**Proposer:** `livetreetech` 

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** Yes 

# Project Description

As part of creating a fair web we will utilise filecoin as decentralised storage for large sets of video files and related web meta-data. The decentralised storage of videos and their associated source meta-data facilitates a set of decentralised marketplaces, namely: royalty payments, programmatic ads, recommendation engines and a range of video machine learning tools such as speech-to-text and learning aids.
We anticipate wide adoption as there is currently no simple way to capture and ingest live video, video and related web meta-data to effectively enable decentralised marketplaces and machine learning tools.

## Value

Fair web is valuable for FileCoin because it aligns values in usage, from raw video and blob storage, introducing structured meta-data marketplace protocols to the total number of general users. Please read more about the project here: www.livetree.com

We also envisage that it will expand and extend projects FileCoin has previously funded such as:  

DID Authentication: https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/pull/156
Prometeus: https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/pull/80/commits
Wallet: https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/pull/69
Reputation System: https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/25


### What are the benefits to getting this right?
The fair web meta-data harnesses the power of IPLD and FileCoin as a distributed file storage, and facilitates a number of recommendation systems, machine-learning services that have already been built and are in production, along with wide-stream user adoption. The fair web protocol is the foundation for the next Livetree infrastructure. In its current implementation it is a successful project when measured by the number of users and existing video capabilities. If this project is successfully implemented, this audience would contribute to the mass adoption of FileCoin


### What are the risks if you don't get it right?
FileCoin has relatively low risk as the grant budget is paid on a milestone basis and each milestone has its own defined deliverables. There is potential to build micro-products from each milestone output.

### What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult?

FileCoin has no standard way to implement structured tabular data (against user defined IPLD keys) and ability to delete files on-demand, these issues are expected to be solvable, however, do pose potential risks.


## Deliverables

An open-source data format and set of tools for file insertion and retrieval.

The existing infrastructure’s data format will be made open-source, they are currently used in livetree production systems and have drawn inspiration from RDF, namely, Sir Tim Berners-Lee https://solid.mit.edu/ DID https://w3c.github.io/did-core/ and the underlying IPLD protocol 
Tools will include linking structured data sources via IPLD to standard video file insertion with related storage and streaming costs migrated to FileCoin. 

There will be several elements such as web-api, user mobile applications and angular web-apps.

## Development Roadmap

### Milestone 1
Goals:
1. Document existing protocol and release IPFS/IPLD specifications documents
	* 2 team members to extend architecture and define specifications
	* 2 weeks
	* $2,000

Cost: $2,000

Time: 2 weeks

### Milestone 2
Goals:
1. File storage: adding video files and retrieving, optimising existing blob and CDN delivery costs to use FIL
	* 1 backend developer
	* 4 weeks
	* $10,000
2. Token-Swap: exchange SED tokens (which are used within the Livetree ecosystem) and FIL in both ways.
	* 1 backend developer
	* 4 weeks
	* $10,000

Cost: 20,000

Time: 4 weeks

### Milestone 3
Goals:
1. Add video player play-back meta-data to FileCoin using FIL
	* 1 frontend developer 
	* 1 backend developer
	* 4 weeks
	* $8,000
2. Add programmatic advertising ad insertion audit to FileCoin using FIL
	* 1 frontend developer
	* 1 backend developer
	* 4 weeks
	* $8,000
3. Add video machine learning (specifically translations) meta-data to FileCoin using FIL
	* 2 Backend developers
	* 4 weeks
	* $8,000

Cost: $24,000

Time: 4 weeks

### Milestone 4
Goals:
1. Final consolidation with other FileCoin projects
2. Roadmap for extension to the Fair Web
3. Production deployment
4. Main network of the FileCoin
5. QA and bug-fixing
6. Technical documentation
7. Optional recommendation: Utilise some amount of FIL to market the adoption of FileCoin e.g. free storage space give-away promotions etc.

Cost: $5,000

Time: 4 weeks

## Total Budget Requested

* Milestone 1: $2,000
* Milestone 2: $20,000
* Milestone 3: $24,000
* Milestone 4: $5,000

Total: $51,000

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

Upon project realisation it will be open source so various communities will be able to extend and enhance it with additional features, being open-source we anticipate a number of projects being able to leverage the underlying data in ever increasing ways. We have close connection with Goldsmith University London data science group, in particular, Dr. Jamie Ward is an advisor to the project. He currently is a lecturer at Goldsmith’s and works within the data science group teaching machine learning. Bug fixes will be completed on demand, we will take care to ensure upgrades are compatible with FileCoin.

## Relevant Experience

We have been working within the decentralised ledger technology sector for a number of years and have completed live production systems for streaming and live video. We have been monitoring IPFS since its inception and now believe with the launch of FileCoin we are in a stable enough state to successfully execute this project. Furthermore, we have deep experience with video analysis and machine learning with support and integration points to MicroSys and Microsoft media video services.
