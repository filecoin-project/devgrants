# Project Description
For retrieve markets of Filecoin, data traffic occurs off chain and results should be submitted to chain. To achieve this, client node should send receipts to retrieving miner on accepted data.

Cause it was designed as every 256KB per chunk and length of receipt should be about 160Bytes, occupying about 0.1% bandwith of total nodes. It would mean that if filecoin had 100T bandwith,  on chain bandwith for receipts  would be about 100G, and tps would reach 100G/160 = 625M, which was unaccpetable.

We present a algorithm call MRD(Mergable Receipts Delivery) to solve this problem.


## Value
With MRD, client node sends receipt to retrieval node on each data chunk, retrieval node collects receipts. Multiple receipts can be merged to one, retrieval miner can merge, pack these receipts and broadcast to chain periodly.
We have tested this algorithm in thounds of retrieval nodes and millions of clients, and proved it worked well.

There are still some risks should be considered:
1. Malicious client nodes may deny to send receipts after data accepted, a machanism should be used to reduce the cheating and a reputation sub-system should be used increase the cost of cheater.
2. Retrieval nodes send packed receipts periodly, corresponded client nodes may out of token that time, and strategies of data traffic should be carefully considered.


## Deliverables

* thesis describes the algrorithm and proof:
  * main workflow
  * detailed description for each step
  * proof
* reference design code or
* Well-documented, human-readable codebase, pluggable and adapted to go-filecoin.

## Total Budget Requested

Total budget costs from $200K up to $550K, to achieve a robust and stable version to used in production version

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

This algrorithm and its implementation will be open source, and will be designed as a consensus module eash to integrated.

## Relevant Experience

1. Adapted ethereum to dynamic shard blockchains and reached 2000 tps with 64 shards, because of PoW, it was much vulnerable when sharded(2018)


 2. In 2019, we have developed ESWARM - a decentralized storage and distribution network, running on thousands of nodes in China, and served several customs. ESWARM is based on ethereumâ€™s swarm, and optimized for video, especially for apples m3u8 stream. With zipped peer-to-peer receipts, ESWARM can record and calculate data transactions between millions of nodes--we have deployed thousands of full nodes and served millions of light(client) nodes.
