# Open Grant Proposal: `Active Miner Discovery `

**Active Miner discovery**

**Proposal Category:** `app-dev`

**Proposer:** [@mgarciap](https://github.com/mgarciap)

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** Yes

# Project Description

An additional service combined with the Filecoin [CID checker and Storage Orace](https://github.com/protofire/filecoin-CID-checker).

The application will automatically ping storage miner nodes, collect responses from the _active_ miners, and aggregate their *Asks* on one screen providing the following information:

- Miner ID
- Storage volume
- Price
- Other valuable information TBD

A new **"Search by Miner ID"** mechanism will be implemented allowing for checking available free storage volumes and price of a certain Miner.

## Value

Currently there are no services enabling Users to easily find active storage miner *Asks* in one place and understand the current pricing market. 

The Miner discovery service will benefit from synergy effect with the **Filecoin CID checker** developed by Protofire, as both services have a common type of User and can be run on one Filecoin node.

The team doesn't anticipate any significant risks to the project implementation, since the data retrieval methods are similar to those recently implemented in our Filecoin CID checker project.


## Deliverables

- Open source repositories dual-licensed (under MIT and APACHE2) licenses for Frontend and Backend
- A service that will allow any network participant to access a new section of the the CID checker webapp and see the list of active storage miners and their prices
- API providing the same information
- Documentation

  - The code is added to the GitHub repository designated by the Filecoin team
  - Detailed `Readme.md` explaining how to run, test and deploy the application as well as how to contribute
  - Instruction for end-users covering successful and alternative scenarios with troubleshooting details
- Outcomes:
  - All project deliverables are completed and added to the Github repository indicated by Filecoin (website, documentation, codebase)
  - A tested version is running and available for testing from the side of Filecoin team
- Duration: 0.5 week
- Team: Part-time QA engineer, Part-time Go engineer, Part-time Frontend developer, Part-time Tech analyst/PM
- Budget: $3,120

### Milestone 5 - Integration and Deployment to production
- Goals:
  - Integrate the Active Miner discovery service into the Filecoin CID checker service node running on the latest version of Lotus network
- Deliverables: 
  - New page and API successfully running on the Lotus node along with the CID Checker
- Outcomes:
  - Users can navigate to the URL and switch between two screens: the Filecoin CID checker and the Active Miner discovery. Also, access through the API
- Duration: 0.5 week
- Team: Full-time Go engineer, Part-time PM
- Budget: $2,430

## Total Budget Requested

| Milestone No. | Milestone Description | Funding | Estimated Timeframe |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | System Design and Data mapping | $2,860 | 0.5 week|
| 2 | Backend development | $5,720 | 1 week|
| 3 | UI/UX and Frontend development | $5,720 | 1 week|
| 4 | QA and documentation | $3,120 | 0.5 week|
| 5 | Integration and Deployment to production | $2,430 | 0.5 week|

Project duration: 4 weeks
Total funding: $19,850 (including 10% of total effort for communication)

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

As the CID Checker service hosted by Protofire, Active Miner Discovery service will work with at minimum a Filecoin lotus node at Filecoin mainnet launch and for 2 months thereafter. Any updates needed to ensure a live, functional service at launch and for 2 months thereafter with a lotus Filecoin node should be performed at no additional cost unless Filecoin nodes or Filecoin Network have undergone significant changes since Protofireâ€™s commencement of the project. In this case, Protofire will request additional funding should the changes implementation require more than 10 hours/month.

Comment: critical bugs will be fixed for a period of up to 2 months after mainnet launch.
Bugs and feature requests will be created in the Github repository.
After this period, major upgrades and feature requests will be subject to new grants.
