# Open Grants

## About

This grant type funds the creative use of Filecoin. Here, deliverables, milestones, and funding limits are generally clearly scoped. Deviations from the specified scope of the project must be approved between the team and the Foundation grants team. 

Open grants work within a few core categories.  

- **Core development**: With this track, we will fund collaborators with proposals tackling core protocol research, specification, and implementation work. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`category:core-dev`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Acore-dev).

- **Application development**: We’re seeking talented application developers to build useful and delightful applications that utilize Filecoin as the decentralized storage layer. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`category:app-dev`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Aapp-dev).

- **Developer tools and libraries**: We are always looking for proposals for the development of developer tools and libraries for both core protocol developers and application developers. Dev tools at all layers of the stack are invaluable! Relevant proposals should be labeled [`category:devtools-libraries`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Adevtools-libraries).

- **Technical design**: We want ideas that will improve on the Filecoin protocol technical design, for example improvement proposals on the core storage protocol, cryptoeconomics design, or on other planned network upgrades. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`category:technical-design`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Atechnical-design).

- **Documentation**: We understand how crucial documentation is for any open-source project and we welcome proposals to create or improve existing Filecoin project documentation. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`category:docs`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Adocs).

- **Community**: We would like to support community initiatives throughout the global Filecoin ecosystem. We have a standing RFP for hosting community meetups, and are generally excited to hear about all sorts of community initiatives. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`category:community`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Acommunity).

- **Research**: We are keen on receiving proposals that explore the meta processes and incentives of decentralized storage. Relevant proposals should be labeled  [`category:research`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3research).

## ⌛ After you apply

After you submit your proposal, you can expect the following to occur:

- We will review your application. During review, we will add comments, questions, change requests, et cetera on your team's submission.
- After a few round trips of discussion, our team will make a decision on which proposals to fund and which not to. <!--Accepted proposals will be merged into the appropriate directory, i.e. either [`open-grant`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/tree/master/open-grant) or [`rfp-proposals`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/tree/master/rfp-proposals).-->
- During the discussion and review phase, we will contact your team for financial and legal follow-ups, such as to confirm milestones and funding, your team's legal structure, etc.
- If your team is accepted, we will ask you to sign our Open Source Software Grant Agreement, which will include a copy of the work plan and funding milestones. 
- We aim to complete all review within a few weeks after the wave deadline, so please stay vigilant on GitHub.
