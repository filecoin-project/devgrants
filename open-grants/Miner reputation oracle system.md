# Open Grant Proposal: Miner reputation oracle system

**Name of Project:** Miner reputation oracle system

**Proposal Category:**  

**Proposer:** 

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** yes

# Project Description

The reputation oracle system will give Filecoin miners access to reputable miners or pools in the NEAR network, have the Dapp on the NEAR network provide Filecoin-related services based on the parameters in the contract.

The Miner Reputation System provides a multi-dimensional data base for integration with other applications,  eg: byte power、actual power、expected block win rate、 miner balance、committed、 storage、scale、calculation power and so on.

The reputation system is an integral part of the filecoin network. but the existing reputation system is not very universal and has not yet brought it into the blockchain network. 

Provide miner evaluation strategies with different focuses for Dapp in different business scenarios.

We alwasy believe that Openess Tansparency and Common is a core value of a reputation system.

## Value

* **Provide FileCoin network miner comprehensive evaluation information and fair parameter information for Dapp on Near network**
* **Links to the respective advantages and features of FileCoin network and Near network**
* **Provide reliable miner evaluation information for Defi projects that pledge mining**
## Deliverables

### Near Contract

Near contract is mainly used to store the reputation value and corresponding parameters of each miner

### FileCoin Reputation Oracle system

This is a miner's aggregated reputation system service that aggregates existing reputation systems and self-developed reputations and sends the final aggregated data to the contract template of near network, 

contains data on the chain and corresponding proofs.

## Development Roadmap

## Primitives

The reputation value of the reputation system is evaluated and reputation aggregate value is sent to the smart contract of Near network.

* Provide centralized service of up-chain data proof
* Smart contracts that support multiple evaluation schemes
### M1

Reputation system service core function development. core contract development for near contracts. the contract should support the calculation scheme of reputation value in different business scenarios. more mining reputation assessment schemes will be supported for different business types in the future.

### M2

Connect and debug the two core systems, finish the development of mvp version.

Integrate a third-party reputation system.

### M3

Stability testing and problem feedback modification,  conduct public testing.

#### Roles

Melvin:       Lead Architect and Developer

Lee Jin:      Architect and Developer

Cherry:       Architect and Developer

Total = around 3.5 months

## Total Budget Requested

Back End =  4k/month
