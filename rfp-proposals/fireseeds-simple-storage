# Project Description

We would like to develop a file storage application by using Filecoin capability. The application would allow the end-user to drag and drop a file to the application directly and use the Filecoin native token for payment. With that, we could start to see more applications being build on top of the Filecoin network.

Then we will introduce a simple DAO to imitate the file sharing inside a team/company. If anyone want to create a storage organization, he/she can deploy a smart contract instance on ethereum to control the membership, storage accesibility and sharing behaviors.

Generally, it is a simplified and decentralized google drive.
