# Project Description

The world is moving by leaps and bounds towards global digitalization of almost every little thing that can only be imagined. According to statistics for the beginning of 2021, 7.8 billion people live in the world, with 5.22 billion using mobile phones, and 4.66 billion using the Internet. It means that we are already halfway online. That is why digital technologies are being introduced in various spheres of life: industry, economy, education, culture, service, etc. Researchers believe that digital technologies will develop (and are already developing) exponentially every year. This process helps to form more effective communication, provided by digital infrastructures. As a result, traditional models of social relations and management are changing. Even a person who lives in undeveloped socio-economic conditions is inevitably included in modern communication processes. In developed societies, information technology is already an integral part of everyday life.

Taking into account these facts, it would be strange to think that the religious sphere is free from all the named processes and phenomena. At all times, religion has existed in such a form as it was understood and experienced by specific people «here and now». This is influenced by specific socio-historical and technogenic circumstances. When crossing the threshold of the temple, a person turns off the sound on the mobile phone, but he CANNOT and DOES NOT want to refuse the device itself. And that's okay. 

Information coverage of the life of religious communities by social media is gaining more and more popularity. For example, live broadcast of worship, religious rites and ceremonies. Links to the Pope's Twitter, kosher and halal search engines, prayer notes, digital fundraising, social media for believers have become commonplace. Modern religions need to incorporate new technologies. It is gradually being introduced into this area as well. The concept of “religion online” sounds quite familiar now. 

Based on the above, it was decided to create an open, public platform for interaction between religious leaders and believers, with a laptop or mobile device.
With a help of NEAR blockchain technology and logical control will be implemented. The Filecoin project will provide storage of appeals, prayers, personal religious paraphernalia (as digital assets of course), etc. The platform will provide an opportunity to choose religion, language, spiritual practices of interest.

## Value

What is blockchain and what does religion have to do with it?
Blockchain is an infinite chain of blocks that stores certain information. Many people believe that only financial information can be placed on the blockchain, but this is not the case. Anything that has a value can be “blockchained” – digitalized.

We are witnessing how a whole artificial world is forming, created by modern information technologies and acting in real time. No matter how you treat it, it is almost impossible to dodge this world, ignore its presence. Moreover, it makes no sense to ignore because informational and communication technologies really facilitate the life of a modern person. Mobile communications have become an integral part of everyday life. We are all involved in virtual routine every day - from communication on social networks to paying for purchases and services.

It is clear that the fact of the fusion of customary and new religious practices is far from being accepted positively by everyone. When the usual stereotypical image of religion crumbles, it is perceived almost as a catastrophe and the fall of foundations. There is no catastrophe here. There is a renewal of non-functional institutions and practices and their replacement with functional ones for modern seekers of religious meanings. Moreover, digitalization encourages religious organizations to innovate in technology - develop and implement technologically new products and processes, significantly improved services or ways of delivering them. We believe that blockchain can help with this. 

The peculiarity of this technology is that it is impossible to change or falsify data. All transactions are transparent, since decentralized data verification and verification using digital signatures are used.
Some people take this idea with enthusiasm and believe that "due to the functions of the blockchain, people themselves will vote and approve changes in the main documents of their religion, collectively identify their spiritual mentors and honestly collect and track cash flows for the needs of their church and parishioners."
There is certainly a risk that people will not accept such an idea at first. However, faith is not necessarily a visit to a real temple, but also what is in the heart of a person. Moreover, in contrast to real life, such an approach excludes the illegal distribution of donors' funds. It also gives access to God to disabled people from anywhere. We strive for equality and transparency for all.

# Additional Information

We live in a very exciting time – a turning point in the development of humanity as a race. Our team believes that we are not on the verge of a technological revolution. Correct total digitalization with the introduction and popularization of decentralized blockchain technologies in all population groups can lead to the fact that more people will be able to enjoy the benefits of civilization. We believe that this path should start with the introduction of services that can be a synergy of spirituality, science and technology. These concepts can neither exclude nor replace each other.

The main idea is to create a place in the metauniverse, which will be completely analogous to the Christian Church, Mosques, Synagogues, etc. Many churches already have terminals with some services, so digitalizations is already here, we aim to decentralize this process and make it even more accessible. This is more than true during a pandemic, when such services are often unattainable offline. God is always NEAR, anywhere for EVERYONE.
