# Project Description

EpiK Protocol proposed a solution of decentralized knowledge graph collaboration platform, where every user could contribute freely with efficiency and fairness. On EpiK network, we deployed IPFS technology to storage small KG bin-log files with the implementation of customized Filcoin Layer2 network; EPK token is given to contributors as incentive to encourage knowledge crowdsourcing; EVM is integrated to introduce more DeFi applications for better circulation of the token ecosystem. 

In such way, EpiK envisions to building a large-scale collaboration platform, where data flows freely, stimulating the growth of KG ecosystem, thus enables AI to evolve from perceptual intelligence to cognitive intelligence.

## Deliverables

1. Trusted Storage - Integrated Filecoin Layer2 network

2. Trusted Incentive - Customized token economy model with 5 roles to maximize individual interests

3. Trusted Governance - Implemented DAO with deep binding of interests and voting power

4. Trusted Finance - Inegrated EVM, cross-chain gateways, oracles, and lending services

## Relevant Experience

1. EpiK mainnet will be launched in May. Currently the Testnet has entered the final stage, with 5700 miners participated. It is estimated that over 30,000 miners will join the mainnet mining. The team pays a lot of attention on ecosystem building and consturting the community support.
2. The valuation for series A is 50 million USD. Both EpiKâ€™s product and the mainnet are ready. The next step is market expansion. 
3. EpiK is the first project to deploy IPFS tehnoloty to the construction of the large-scale collaboration of data knowledge graph. Its solution is similar to Ocean Protocol, both building a data sharing economy based on token economy. While EpiK has the advantage of tapping the Chinese AI industrial data. The future implementation has great potential.
4. James and Leo were partners back in 2017, when both worked for Nebulas, one of the most noted public chains. Leo, the lead dev, and James, the head of BD, have worked together for 4 years. Leo had led the development of two protocol projects. Eliza, a friend of the founder, is majored in Fin-tech and specialized in BD. Previously worked at the semiconductor manufacturing company Infineon, she entered the blockchain industry at the beginning of 2019. She helped establish a community of 100,000 people. The market cap of the project had ranked top 20. Early investors had a return rate of about 200. The team has worked seamlessly with each other.

# Additional Information

As EpiK partners with top academic institutions such as Big Data Lab of Tsinghua University and data enterprises such as ChinaSoft, EpiK has better access to Chinese industrial data than companies outside of China. EpiK could be complimentary to the Filecoin ecosystem, where EpiK provides diversified datasets. 

Moreover, with over 9,000 users in the Chinese community, EpiK could further increase the recognition of Filecoin, together they could build a better data economy.

Currently in series A funding, with a valuation of 50 million USD, EpiK has attracted noted VCs including two institutional investors and one US fund. We believe together we will bring synergy to the IPFS ecosystem.
