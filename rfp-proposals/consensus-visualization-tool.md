# RFP: Consensus Visualization Tool

**Name of Project:** `Consensus Visualization Tool`

**Proposal Category:** `app-dev`

**Proposal Type:*** `rfp`

## Summary
This document outlines Protofireâ€™s (a sub-division of [Altoros](https://www.altoros.com/)) proposition on providing a blockchain specialist developer team to build the [Consensus Visualization Tool](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/rfps/rfp-consensus-visualization-tool.md#rfp-consensus-visualization-tool). We believe that we can build a robust solution and contribute with our experience to the Filecoin network community.

## Who we are

[Protofire](https://protofire.io) is a team of engineers that helps providers of decentralized protocols, infrastructures and developer platforms accelerate growth of their ecosystems. By providing hands-on coding and contributions, Protofire specializes in supercharging developer adoption and network usage. We ship applications, smart contracts, and developer tools (SDKs/APIs/sample apps), as well as assist you in improving performance/cost of oracles.

Having been interested in Filecoin, our team researched the network to get a deeper understanding of the structure, scalability, and security. 

Having experience working with different protocols, networks and as specialists in developing blockchain technologies, we believe that our team qualifies as suitable for delivering the Consensus Visualisation tool.

#Consensus Visualization Tool

## Objetives

The objectives of this proposal is to develop an open-source blockchain consensus visualization tool that demonstrates Filecoin's [Expected Consensus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/rfps/rfp-consensus-visualization-tool.md#about-expected-consensus-ec) process. It must show the main chain and also other forks.

## Deliverables

This proposal covers all the deliverables described in the RFP that is available by this [link](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/rfps/rfp-consensus-visualization-tool.md#deliverables). \
Additional deliverables are:


*   Open source Github repository with public access
*   Hosted application working with Testnet and Mainnet
*   The tutorial with demo usage that will be published in the repo.
*   Blog post that will be published on Protofire medium account and shared through linkedin, twitter and other platforms
*   Updated estimates for milestones 2-4

## Scope of Work
Below you can find the table describing the milestones schedule, tasks and deliverables that are based on the the requirements stated in [RFP](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/rfps/rfp-consensus-visualization-tool.md).

## Assumptions
*   Code will be hosted in the public Protofire Github repository
*   Long term maintenance should be agreed with Filecoin
*   We assume that API ([Lotus](https://lotu.sh/en+api#what-methods-can-i-use-20883)) has all necessary endpoints and is well documented so that the visualization tool can consume the corresponding data and transform it into a graphical representation.
*   We recommend starting with sprint 0 for the milestone 1, to define UI mockups and endpoints.
*   The frontend and backend will be hosted by Filecoin

## Acceptance Criteria

The proposed tool will adhere to the acceptance criteria defined [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/rfps/rfp-consensus-visualization-tool.md#acceptance-criteria). Before starting the project we will make a detailed document with the acceptance criteria based on the final scope.

### Protofire Relevant Experience

Protofire has delivered a network explorer for the [Enigma Protoco](https://enigma.co)l that is similar to the Consensus Visualization Tool. Enigma Network Explorer demonstrates the Enigma Consensus process handling events and data for workers (nodes), epochs(rounds), tasks and users. Users can follow up on the status and statistical information of the network. This app works with complex architecture processing data from Ethereum and Enigma network.

We built a robust infrastructure behind the Dapp where we process the Ethereum data through building a [subgraph](https://thegraph.com/), increasing the data access speed to the frontend and creating a backend API (NodeJs) in order to process statistical data and manage complex formulas to handle different events. The complete solution was developed using containers based on docker-compose that allowed for easy deployments on cloud services.

Our engineering team was responsible for the complete development process from business analysis, scope, data schema definition and UI/UX design to the development and QA. The development team focused on building a stable and robust backend while ensuring the strong user experience.

## Project Management

The Project Manager will be the primary Point of Contact for Filecoin. Work arrangements and communication plans include:

*   Team will be working remotely across geographies and timezones.
*   Shared Slack channel will be set up to maintain active dialogue with the Filecoing team.
*   Slack webhooks will be set up from all project management tools for visibility on progress.
*   Visibility will be ensured through weekly updates, demos, time and progress reports.
*   Team will be working based on 2-week sprints and follow Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban).
*   The project is organized through a board that allows daily monitoring. We recommend Zenhub.


## Grant Payment Terms

This is a proposal for a fixed bid grant. Filecoin is requested to pay as follows:

*   50% upon start of the project (USD 15K) and 50% (USD 15K) upon project completion, with net15 payment terms.
*   Any changes to the scope of work or overages to the price must be agreed in writing by the parties through a change request.
*   All work is expected to be done remotely, with no travel required.
