# Project Description

Hi there, we're the Hercules Development team. We've been enjoying IPFS for sometime and would like to be a part of this jounrey as it scales. We plan to have our designet whip up some really sleek UI for a Block Explorer we would use (as devs and a use case) as well as one that others interested in the FIL ecosystem would enjoy and understand intuitively.
For Milestone 1 we should have the mocks and the basic ui on a staging environment, and hopefully if the docs are good we'll have basic realtime dev data from the FIL network populating the fields. 
For Milestone 2 we'd like to work closelt with those in charge to ensure Milestone 1 is behind us while improving the useability oand complete functionality of the exploree. 
For Milestone 3 we'll have everything documented appropiatelt so anyone can build it while deciding an appropiate maintainence agreement post build. 


## Deliverables

A fully functional Block Explorer as described in the RFP.
