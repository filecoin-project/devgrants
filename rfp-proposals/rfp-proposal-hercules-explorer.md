# Project Description

Hi there, we're the Hercules Development team. We've been enjoying IPFS for sometime and would like to be a part of this jounrey as it scales. We plan to have our designer whip up some really sleek UI for a Block Explorer we would use (as devs and a use case) as well as one that others interested in the FIL ecosystem would enjoy and understand intuitively.
- For Milestone 1 we will have the mocks and the basic ui on a staging environment, and hopefully if the FIL docs are good we'll have basic realtime dev data from the FIL network populating the fields. 
- For Milestone 2 we'd like to work closely with those in charge to ensure Milestone 1 is behind us while improving the useability and complete functionality of the explorer. 
- For Milestone 3 we'll have everything documented appropiately so anyone can build it while deciding an appropiate maintainence agreement post build. 


## Deliverables

A fully functional Block Explorer as described in the `app-dev` RFP.

## Development Roadmap

Please break up your development work into a clear set of milestones. You can use the milestones suggested in the RFP or create your own. This section needs to be very detailed (will vary on the project, but aim for around 2 pages for this section).

For each milestone, please describe:
M1:
- UI and Staging under an https:// to tool around in. Will be built in React and Node so as to be available on both desktop and mobile envs. 
- 1 project manager, 1 designer, and 2 developers (front & back end)
- Our proposed budget for Milestone 1 is 65,000 Euro which can be paid in BTC, ETH, or Wire.
- With a funds cleared for Milestone 1 we can assume this task will take 1 month and 2 weeks to bring to the standard requested in the RFP. Any scope time will be carried into Milestone 2 whereas time is applicable when FIL leaders approve of the UI in staging.
M2: 
- Work will begin on Milestone 2 when the Milestone 1 UI is approved and finalized. We will get the front end on a real site (thinking https://filyourblock) with real / dev network data populating the fields. This will be functional with associated code in the designated repository.
- We will need 1 project manager and 3 developers during Milestone 2 to stay within scope time.
- To compensate our proposed budget for Milestone 2 is 75,000 Euro paid in BTC, ETH, or Wire.
- With funds cleared for Milestone 2 we can assume this task will take 1 month 3 weeks to finalize the standard requested in the RFP. Any scope creep will be carried into Milestone 3.
M3:
- Finalize documentation, finalize scope of RFP, finalize agreement for post work 
- We will need 1 developer and 1 project manager during Milestone 3 to stay within scope time. An executive business developer will handle the post build maintenance agreement.
- To compensate our proposed budget for Milestone 3 is 20,000 Euro paid in BTC, ETH, or Wire.
- With funds cleared for Milestone 3 we can assume this task will take roughly 1 month with finalized testing. 

If approved Milestone 1 through Milestone 3 should take 4 months an 1 week if all proposed budget is paid in a timely manner with FIL leadership available for day-to-day checkups and approval of design and measure. 

## Total Budget Requested

170,000 Euro paid in BTC, ETH, or Wire.

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

We plan to have our SVP handle the post maintenance agreement. 
We'd like to continue to build with the FIL leadership and community and can come to negotiable terms post build that benefit everyone.
