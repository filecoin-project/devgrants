# Project Description

We are trying to build a  real-world application that can help users to do these actions on Hedera and Filecoin(all of those actions will cost HBAR and FIL):
 * create/mint NFT
 * stake/rent NFT 
 * compose NFT
 * open an NFT exchange market some kind like [OpenSea Partners](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/opensea-partners-program), but have different logic as we do not work on OpenSea

During the creation of the application, we extra the code into a `ready-to-use scaffold` template that makes every new developer on Hedera and Filecoin start to build their idea very fast.

# Value to the Filecoin and Hedera ecosystems

* It provides an off-the-shelf stack for rapid MVP on the Filecoin and Hedera
* Giving the developer quickly learn and ship Filecoin and Hedera based dApp
* The Launched real world product [NTB](https://nfttop.best) will be Hedera version of the `OpenSea`
* It allows new Hedera Developers to quickly build and iterate over better ecosystem

# Deliverables

* A real world web application(now just have very little code online) that launch at [NTB](https://nfttop.best)
* A TypeScript SDK publish in the org: [web3-sdk](https://github.com/web3-sdk)
* A `ready-to-use scaffold` web-app template publish in the org: [web3-awesome](https://github.com/web3-awesome)
* (this will not deliver during the three months scope) A `ready-to-use scaffold` mobile-app(A hybird solution use vue and can build the iOS/Android/6+mini program platforms) that help new developer build new mobile-app fast. Also it will be publish in the org: [web3-awesome](https://github.com/web3-awesome)

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

We will provide reasonable maintenance to the open-source product. We will also likely (based on reception) continue building functionality to find sustainability for the project. 

We will make the [NTB](https://nfttop.best) to be the NFT areas' top application that have all-platform app(iOS/Android/h5/web-app), also build the ecosystems includes discord bots/twitter etc.

Also make the [web3-awesome](https://github.com/web3-awesome) and [web3-sdk](https://github.com/web3-sdk) have more and more sub-projects while develop the [NTB](https://nfttop.best).

In the very end we will have the full-stack solution for Hedera and Filecoin platform that help developer build the dApp very quick and don't need to reinvent the wheel.
