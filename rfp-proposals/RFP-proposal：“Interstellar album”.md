**Name of Project:**Interstellar album

**Proposal Category:**  `app-dev`

**Proposer:** `Jonney hu`

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:**  "Yes" 

# Project Description

- Interstellar album is a cloud photo album application. The starting point is to help users solve the problem of insufficient space when storing photos and videos, as well as high storage costs.Interstellar album can also prevent photos from being lost in mobile phones. Even if the phone is lost, use other devices to log in to Interstellar album, upload it to Interstellar album and retrieve it. All photos and videos are distributed and decentralized. All data can be used only by the users themselves, there will be no security incidents such as leaks, and the security and privacy of user data will be increased.
- Interstellar album is based on blockchain, based on the application developed by Filecoin, perfectly integrated into the blockchain and Filecoin features.


## Value

- If Interstellar album is developed and popularized, users will learn about IPFS through Interstellar album and learn about Filecoin. Then it will build more nodes for IPFS and filecoin, which will break the current problem facing the cloud photo album market: security, privacy. . Become one of the pioneering applications of IPFS and Filecoin in the market, and increase the popularity of IPFS and Filecoin.
- Because Interstellar album is built on top of Filecoin's slice storage technology, we need Filecoin API support.

## Deliverables

- Powerful cloud album application, including "mobile terminal", "web terminal", "PC client terminal"
- Good UX and visual design
- Complete app, documentation, code base

## Development Roadmap

- |phase|Milestone description|role|Number|funds|schedule|


- |---|---------|-----------|---------|----------|-------|
- |1|Design prototype, front-end frame|PM/UI/FE|4|$2400|3 weeks (October 7-28)|
- |2|Backend development, function realization|RD|3|$4800|4 weeks (October 28 - November 28)|
- |3|Documentation, testing|PM/STE|2|$400|1 week (November 28 - December 05)|
- |4|Develop web and PC clients|Software Department|8|$9600|6 weeks (December 05 - January 17, 2020)|
- |5|Long-term maintenance and update|PM|1|$1000|1 year (January 2020 - January 2021)|


- ###Phase 1
  
    We mainly built the Interstellar album application framework, designed the Interstellar album mobile terminal, and completed the front-end development.
- ###Phase 2 

  Development background, in the absence of Filecoin API support, provide centralized temporary services, which can be used for basic function services. (if Filecoin API is accessed, it will be officially enabled)
- ###Phase 3

    Complete the test work and write related documents
- ###Phase 4 

  Research and development of web and PC clients based on the Interstellar album mobile terminal
- ###Phase 5

    The Interstellar album is iteratively updated based on market and user feedback to make it more market-ready.

## Relevant Experience

Our team is constantly demonstrating the expertise of protocols and distributed storage systems research, launching white papers from FIlecoin, and actively participating in several laboratory workshops in the FIL ecosystem. Since the beginning of Filecoin in September 2018, our team has delved into Filecoin's research, coding and ecosystem development. We also developed the mining machine cluster relationship system and the Filecoin distribution system, which is fully prepared for the arrival of Filecoin. In addition, we also focus on IPFS-based, Filecoin-based ecosystem application development.
