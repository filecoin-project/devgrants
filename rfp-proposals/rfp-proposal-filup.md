# Project Description

Automation of Devnet deployment, providing a tool for developers to start building Apps on Filecoin with minimal friction. For this use case we propose to build automation with Docker compose as there is a high number of developers that do not have a k8s cluster at their disposal. 

## Deliverables
 - Allow users to setup a Devnet with docker compose (nodes,  genesis miner, explorer)
 - Configure parameters

## Development Roadmap

 ### Milestone 1 - Docs and preparation

 	 * 1 team member
 	 * 1 week
 	 * 1000$

Goal: Write docs and prepare for development

 ### Milestone 2 - Docker compose automation 
 
 	* 2 team members
 	* 3 week
 	* 6000$  

Goal: Configuration files for: bootstrap, faucet, miner and explorer nodes.


 ### Milestone 3 - Configuration and improved development experience
 
 	* 1 team members
 	* 2 week
 	* 2000$  

Goals: Develop CLI for configuration of the automation scripts:

## Total Budget Requested

 - Milestone 1: $1,000
 - Milestone 2: $6,000
 - Milestone 3: $2,000

 Total: $9,000

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

We have started minefilecoin.io with the mission to support miners and developers with tools that will allow our community to build a reliable network, with the necessary QoS to be a become widely spread, this is one of the core efforts required to get to that point, we will happily keep maintaining it as we will heavy users of it.

## Relevant Experience

I was a founder of Tenderly, a smart contracts development platform where I spent the last 2 years developing infrastructure that helps Ethereum developers build smart contracts more effectively, this included monitoring, alerts, gas profilers, analytics and debugging functionalities. I also competed in several ETHGlobal hackathons where I was winner of [ETHBerlin 2018](https://devpost.com/software/smart-alert-s5p1zw) and [ETHParis](https://devpost.com/software/zippo). Our team was also an early user of Docker and Kubernetes and held several [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8Oo5Db4bsA) back in 2015.
