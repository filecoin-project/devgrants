# Brief Description

We are going to build a decentralized storage SDK for Hedera and a real-world application that uses that SDK to manage metadata and mint NFTs to Hedera. The application can also showcase to developers how easy it is using the SDK to upload files to IPFS/Filecoin and minting NFTs to Hedera.

# Project Description

We plan to build an SDK to help web3 builders uploading files to IPFS/Filecoin and minting NFTs to Hedera. Besides that, we'll also provide a real-world application that uses the SDK enables creators to manage metadata and mint NFTs.

The application is a product that can help web3 developers and meta creators to manage their media assets and metadata effortlessly all-in-one place. Beyond that, the creators can also mint the metadata as NFTs to Hedera and create a lightweight storefront just in one click. Furthermore, the collectors can use FIL and HBAR to buy the NFTs in the storefront.
