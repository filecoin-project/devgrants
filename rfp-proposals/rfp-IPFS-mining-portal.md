# Project Description

China’s IPFS market is huge but with many scams. There are now over a hundred companies registered to focus on mining equipment production, sales and services, but there are hundreds of companies or small teams false claim their equipment capacity and pre-sale unvalidated equipment to small investors illegally, and it is not just jeopardizing the current market, but potentially raising the severe issue from the relevant government or legal department for an unnecessary ban on the mining market in China(happened to Bitcoin mining industry before).

However, if you search IPFS in Baidu, a leading searching engine in China, you’ll see numerous advertisements for mining machines, while at least 90% of them are financial frauds in the name of IPFS. Current problems in the market are:

* Low grade assembled mining machines sell at a high price
* Financial fraud 
* Blind boasting of coin price and futures trading 
* One machine, multiple uses 
* Endless fake news in the public test period 
* Using the official team’s words to generate hype or a fake relationship 

So it is more than crucial for investors (both from China market and also investors outside China) to identify criteria to avoid scams, and by setting up a neutral, transparent evaluation platform for reviewing the performance and feature of all types of equipment and services can be an immediate and best solutions to that problem. This platform can help millions of investors to check on the live database (provided both from protocol labs and all market players) and also submit the evidence of scams on the market for the team to check on and help the market stay healthy and fair.

Here, we propose to build an IPFS mining portal rating site offering trusted information and data in the market.
