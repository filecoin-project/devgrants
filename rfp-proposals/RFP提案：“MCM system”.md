# Project Description

- MCM system provides a complete set of management solutions for the mine and mine pool that are not ready yet, so as to make adequate preparations for Filcoin that will be launched soon. For each mine, mine pool to solve how to manage node mining machine, monitoring node mining machine, how to distribute Filecoin and other services, including mining machine management module, mining machine safety monitoring module, data summary module, FIL collection module, distribution module.


## Value

- MCM system helps the mine. The mine pool provides a complete set of convenient services, real-time monitoring node mining machine operation. Facilitating the establishment of mines and pools is easier and simpler. Help more people join Filecoin network, and provide more stable nodes for Filecoin network quickly.

## Deliverables

- A complete functional management system
- User-oriented documentation

    We mainly planned and built the functional modules of the system, and completed the design of high-fidelity prototype drawing.
- ###Phase 2 

  Finish front-end development according to prototype, UX and visual design, complete visual data statistics such as charts.
- ###Phase 3

    Development backend, the development of each module, mining machine management module, mining machine safety monitoring module, data summary module, FIL collection module, distribution module, this is the most important part of the project, in this stage, we will complete the completion of the basic functions of each module.
- ###Phase 4 

  Test the developed system and write related documents for users
- ###Phase 5

    This phase focuses on maintenance and upgrade, tracking users, and better optimizing the system.
