# RFP Proposal: `Simple storage webapps`

**Name of Project: Simple storage webapps**

**Link to RFP:** https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/rfps/new-wave-4-rfps.md#simple-storage-webapps

**RFP Category:** `app-dev`

**Proposer:** `@mattbford`

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** Yes

# Project Description

The RFP states that Filecoin would like single page apps that demonstrate how to use Filecoin to store and retrieve files. These apps would act as visual tutorials to new users and lessen the difficulty of entry. 

The purpose of this proposal is to create a web application that simulates the storage and retrieval of files in filecoin. This will be achieved by building a simple and user friendly web application that interfaces with filecoin's testnet. 

By using the testnet, OpenBound can create an application that will accurately simulate file transfer over the filecoin network.


## Deliverables

- A single page web application that can be used as a tutorial to teach new users how to send and retrieve files using filecoin.
- The application will be accurate to the filecoin network.
- The application will be open-sourced and licensed under APACHE2 and MIT.
- The source code will be appropriately documented.
