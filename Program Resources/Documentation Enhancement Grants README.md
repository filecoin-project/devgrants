Grant proposals should fit within the following focus areas:

- **Comprehensive Developer Guides**: Develop detailed guides for developers covering various aspects of integrating Filecoin into their projects, including setup instructions, API usage, and troubleshooting tips.

- **Interactive Learning Resources**: Develop interactive learning resources such as code playgrounds or interactive demos/videos that allow developers to experiment with Filecoin APIs and tools.

## How to Apply and Review Timeline
To submit a proposal, [create a new issue](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/new/choose) using the â€œDocumentation Enhancement Grants" proposal template.

We aim to notify Documentation Enhancement Grant applicants of the review decision by the end of the month following the application submission date.

- For example, for applications submitted between March 1 and March 31, applicants will be notified by April 30.

Our team may be in touch with questions in the proposal comment section in Github. **Please note that no work should begin without a signed contract.** 

## Award
Grants will be paid out once the following steps are completed:  
- A grant agreement is signed by both parties
- The outlined project work is complete
  - As part of their final submission, all grantees should demonstrate successful usage by members of their intended audience with the intended audience as part of the project completion report.
      - For example, for a tutorial, it should be tested by three to five developers who are not part of the creation team.
- The project work has been reviewed and approved by Filecoin Foundation
- Once a completed project has been reviewed and approved, Filecoin Foundation will make a single payment of up to $5,000 USD or USDC within 30 days.
