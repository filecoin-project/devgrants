# Project Description

## Introduction of Treehouse

Treehouse is a convenient and secure online photo album app for baby journeys. Parents can store the baby's daily life with precious living experience in the family's own Web3 world.

Traditional online photo album services are operated by a single platform company, all album content is under the management of the platform operator. Web3 is de-platformed and uses distributed storage technology. These storage spaces are provided by storage space providers around the world as marketplace There is no storage operator that can access your secure album content, ensuring userâ€™s privacy and security.

## Market Problems

The existing Google Photos and Apple Photos are not designed for children. Currently, the baby journey photo album platform with the highest market share in Asia is operated by China based companies and used by tens of millions of people and more.

After analyzing photos and journey diaries of young children, we can understand the health status, life pattern and geographical distribution of young children, as well as family members and their composition, family background, nannies or schools, teachers and other networks. Platform operators are seriously affecting personal privacy, the most worrying of these is most users are unaware of this.
Solutions

## Distributed Storage

Treehouse uses Web3 content storage technology to ensure the account owner(photo uploader) and authorized family members are the only one who can view the content of the album files. The storage space of the album files is controlled by the user themself. Through the file encryption technology, no company or organization can access content without being authorized by the user. If the Treehouse operator cannot continue the service due to some situations, it will not impact user content or damage the user's content retrieval.

## Security & Privacy Protection

Treehouse uses a Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography service to protect the user's content, and only the user can decrypt the data. Suppose you want to upload your own photo album to Treehouse, the upload tool will help you to perform the AES-256 encryption process when saving the photo file, so the uploaded file is actually encrypted, and only users are able to retrieve and decrypt files. AES-256 is an encryption standard widely used in industry, finance and military. Treehouse does not host the user's password, so there is no possibility of any password leakage.

When you share photos with family members, the system uses p2p encryption to individually transmit the shared decryption key, and does not disclose the user's public key information to avoid the risk of quantum computers doing brute force cracking.
Persistence of file storage

Completely different from platform operators, Treehouse uses Web3 storage technology - IPFS, and these storage spaces are provided by operators of the IPFS protocol all around the world. These services cannot be closed, if the Treehouse App is out of service for some reason, you can still retrieve the album yourself through IPFS protocol.

## Treehouse Technology Overview

The Treehouse service is composed of three major elements.
The first is DID - identity, which creates a representation of users. The second is an integrated API service, which includes internal cloud service for applications and blockchain with decentralized storage service for users.

## Treehouse architecture

## Value

Increased security: Provide greater security for users owned photos compared to traditional centralized storage solutions.

Lower costs: Because Filecoin utilizes a decentralized network of storage providers, it can often offer lower storage costs compared to centralized solutions. This could make it more cost-effective for users to store their photos on Filecoin.

<!-- - What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult? -->

Performance: Decentrolized storage performance may not be as good as some centralized solutions. This could make it challenging to provide a user experience that is fast and reliable enough for a photo storage app.

Complexity: Building an app on top of a decentralized storage protocol like Filecoin can be complex, this could make it difficult to find and hire the necessary talent to execute on the project. The integrated third party API like web3 storage can be options.

User adoption: Finally, there is a risk that users may not be interested in using a decentralized photo storage app, or may not understand how it works. This could make it difficult to gain traction and achieve widespread adoption for the app.
