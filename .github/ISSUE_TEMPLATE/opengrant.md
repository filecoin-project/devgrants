# Project Description

<!-- Please describe exactly what you are planning to build. Make sure to include the following: -->
<!-- - Start with the need or problem you are trying to solve with this project. -->
<!-- - Describe why your solution is going to adequately solve this problem. -->

Itera is a content mining machine & content acceleration network where creators can upload their content and reach their audience directly. By using the most efficient technology for content delivery, Itera ensures great monetary return for creators while providing a high quality experience for a global audience.

Problems with Traditional Online Content Distribution

Content is hosted in data centers controlled by web giants, in a closed Ecosystem.
Content creators receive a very small percentage, if any, of the revenue generated by their content.
The platform service providers take most of the profit generated, content creators only get paid on specific and often unattainable conditions.
Advertisement agencies are obliged to pass by the few dominating companies in the industry, who also control the rates and publish ads under their discretion
The audience does not enjoy the great diversity that creators all over the world can provide because of the centralized and dominating platforms in the industry.

Content miner host Itera One software on pc/laptop or dedicated Itera One home machine, share their home bandwidth and storage space, creating the distributed cloud service for content creators.

By Integrated with blockchain DAPP/IPFS SWAM and micropayment technology, all ecosystem participants can receive a very fair incentive based on an open market.

<!-- This section should be 2-3 paragraphs long. -->

## Value

<!-- Please describe in more detail why this proposal is valuable for the Filecoin ecosystem. Answer the following questions: -->
<!-- - What are the benefits to getting this right? -->
<!-- - What are the risks if you don't get it right? -->
<!-- - What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult? -->
 
 Filecoin is the economic incentive layer to the peer-to-peer decentralized network for sharing and storing of data, by integrated with Itera One DAPP and micropayment technology, all participants can receive more incentive based on an content mining, such as video payment, video sharing and online ads.
 
 Itera Full Nodes index all the content stored on the network while also hosting content like normal nodes do. Itera Full Nodes have higher requirements for the participants while also providing larger incentives. The Full Node ensures an optimal performance for the Itera network, by using real IP for better and faster routing service for Itera Network.
 
 Legal compliance with permissionless video content will be major challenges of Itera business, identity service and content rating system with copyright information are required.

Dear Filecoin Review Team,

We've made a POC demo of Itera at 2019, the first demo is about how backers(Itera users) can mining creator's video, how consumers can using metamask to watch paid-for-view video, how backers can get incentive for video mining(receive token rewards) after consumer paid to creator.

The second video show how ads agency can do the online advisting through the Itera software, consumers can watch free-for-view-with-ads video.

Through the funding from Filecoin team, we can re-start and re-build Itera with Filecoin portocal, make greater contribution to society.
